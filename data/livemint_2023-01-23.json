India\u2019s IT and startup sectors may lay off 15,000 to 20,000 employees in the next six months, battling slowing demand after the hiring frenzy of the last two years inflated salary costs.  Recruitment consultants expect fewer hiring mandates in the months ahead and have decided not to enter new businesses for now. Recruitment consultants expect fewer hiring mandates in the months ahead and have decided not to enter new businesses for now. However, even as some IT and startup companies will shed staff to manage costs, others within the same sectors are hiring, too. \u201cWe expect about 20,000 layoffs over the next few quarters. Over the last year, companies faced the fear of missing out on talent hiring and recruited in large numbers and paid them many folds more than inflation and market standards,\" said Lohit Bhatia, president of workforce management for recruitment firm Quess Corp.  The cost of maintaining that talent has begun to hurt IT firms and startups, Bhatia added. In FY23 so far, the two sectors have laid off more than 20,000 employees, including 1,400 in the first two weeks of January. Many IT product and services firms, edtechs and fintechs are struggling after the over-hiring of pandemic years, when they snapped up talent at steep salaries assuming continued growth. Today, pressure from investors, an expected global recession and the domino impact of global layoffs have combined to result in staff cuts. Last week, Google fired 12,000 employees, joining tech giants such as Meta, Amazon and Microsoft, which have laid off 11,000, 18,000 and 11,000 workers, respectively. \u201cFifteen thousand employees will get retrenched over the next six months, but this will be the last leg of the recession. However, there are skilled employees who are getting absorbed into the industry. Attrition in many of the product or IT service firms are upwards of 15%, which means despite layoffs, there is room for lateral hirings,\" said Kamal Karanth, co-founder of Xpheno, which specializes in technology and startup hiring. IT services companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Tech face high employee costs, even though overall headcount has fallen.  The impact is mostly on junior and middle-level employees, but search firms in charge of senior hiring in tech and startup sectors said leadership hiring had slowed as well. \u201cThere are a couple of cases where the decision-making is getting delayed, but that\u2019s about it. In fact, as a side effect of this retrenchment news, clients have raised their expectations, imagining that a lot of talent is now available,\" said Amit Agarwal, managing director, Singapore and India, Stanton Chase. \u201cHowever, the matter of fact is companies are not letting go of their key talent or high performers at the top. So, the battle for leadership only intensifies,\" he added. Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder and executive director of TeamLease Services, expects employers to remain cautious for at least the first quarter of the new fiscal. \u201cIT hiring has gone down, and there is tepidness in the market,\" Chakraborty said.","scraped_date":"2023-01-23"}

This high court on Friday granted six weeks to Yes Bank to file its appeal against the order in the Supreme Court.  \u201cRBI believes the writ petition is not maintainable and the order could have a huge sectoral impact. The central bank also believes that the administrator had all the powers of the board to write off the bonds and, therefore, the court\u2019s argument is not valid,\" said one of the two officials aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.  RBI approved the Yes Bank administrator\u2019s March 2020 decision to write off the AT-I bonds as part of a restructuring plan to save bank depositors from losing their savings.

An email sent to a spokesperson for RBI went unanswered. The high court, in its order, said that the administrator appointed by the RBI exceeded his powers to write off the AT-I bonds as the decision was taken after the final reconstitution scheme was notified on 13 March 2020. It said that the scheme came into force on 13 March 2020, and the bank stood reconstructed on the same day. The court ruled that AT-I bonds could only be written down before the bank\u2019s reconstruction. It also pointed out that the government-approved reconstruction scheme for Yes Bank did not include a clause for writing down these bonds. However, the court did not consider whether the writing off of the AT-1 bonds was necessary but only looked at the decision-making process. Yes Bank argued that Section 36 AC of the RBI Act allows the administrator to exercise the board\u2019s powers until a new board takes charge. \u201cThe court order is based on two grounds\u2014the date of reconstruction and the administrator did not have the power after the scheme was notified. As far as the first ground is concerned, it is incorrect to say that the date of reconstruction could be the same as the date of notification because it does not take into account the period of implementation of the reconstruction. The second reason is contrary to the RBI Act that merely because the scheme was notified, the administrator cannot exercise any powers,\" said Rohan Dakshini, a lawyer representing Yes Bank and a partner at law firm Rashmikant and Partners. \u201cThe court\u2019s observation on the deletion of the provision of the write-down from the final scheme makes no difference to the exercise by the bank of its contractual rights,\" he added. Following the Bombay high court ruling, bondholders of Lakshmi Vilas Bank also plan to seek an urgent hearing in the Madras high court against the RBI\u2019s decision to write off tier-II bonds worth  \u20b9320 crore, as the government\u2019s approved merger scheme also does not mention write-downs for these bonds.

If you see Adani Transmission, the value accrued over a nine-year period; we started in 2012. Adani Green, we started incubating in 2011, and the value is now emerging. So we need those kinds of investors,\" he added. To draw retail investors, Adani Enterprises will offer an added discount of  \u20b964 per partly paid-up share from the cut-off price. The price range for the FPO, running through 27- 31 January, has been fixed at  \u20b93,112-3,276. Mutual funds, he said, had monetized less than 2% of Indian household wealth, allowing the group to potentially access a vast swathe of savings. It has been engaged in domestic investor outreach for the last three years, he said. \u201cWe have been running roadshows to reach domestic investors across cities: Delhi, Kolkata and Surat for five years, and next month, we will hit Rajkot to increase their count as shareholders across our group verticals. Our aim is to have 10 million retail investors. I am told by some investors that at the roadshows, they are seeing huge interactions between corporate and domestic investors, decades after what Dhirubhai Ambani would do on outreach programmes for domestic investors.\"  On steep valuations of group companies becoming a roadblock for potential retail investors, Singh said: \u201cHigh equity valuations imply that people value our growth and this reduces our risk premium, which in turn will boost the value of our utility business.\" \u201cWe feel across infra like airports, for one, we can reduce tariffs and compete with the best like in Sydney,\" he added. After the  \u20b920,000-crore proposed FPO, retail investors\u2019 holding in Adani Enterprises will increase from around 1.4% to over 3%, while promoter shareholding will drop by 3.6 percentage points. Adani Enterprises\u2019 shares have soared 174% from their 52-week lows in less than 10 months to  \u20b94189.55 on 21 December. The stock has since corrected to  \u20b93,456 apiece on 20 January. On why brokerages avoid including Adani group companies in their coverage universe, Singh said utility businesses are not tracked widely by analysts. But, this would change with time, he added. The follow-on public offer will see the group invest  \u20b910,869 crore for capital expenditure requirements of the company\u2019s subsidiaries in the green hydrogen ecosystem projects, existing airports and for construction of a greenfield expressway, while  \u20b94,165 crore will be used to repay debt either partly or fully as well as for three subsidiaries\u2014Adani Airport Holdings Ltd, Adani Road Transport Ltd, and Mundra Solar Ltd. The rest will be used for general corporate purposes, according to the offer document.  The group is also confident that its green hydrogen business will be operational in four years. \u201cWe are confident that by 2026, hydrogen will be at an operating cost of 25-30 cents. Depending on the rate of return requirement, we will sell it for between $1.80 and 2.30 a kg, which is lower than India\u2019s LNG import cost. So, already it will compete without any government subsidy,\" said Singh. The group has invested $1.6 billion in the hydrogen ecosystem and has signed a memorandum of understanding with French energy major Total. It will be investing 25% equity in the business, he said. The Adani group is also looking at various partnerships for the airport business, he added.  \u201cWe have entered a joint venture in the duty-free area. In airports, you have specific elements that address a specific consumer base, and we are looking at other JVs in fuel services and public entertainment space, among others,\" Singh said.","scraped_date":"2023-01-23"}

She also said that talks are underway with Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) for the procurement of carbon dioxide from the company and the required investment amount would depend upon the cost for carbon dioxide procurement. \u201cWe want to take in carbon dioxide and pump it underground, store it in the field which has been producing for a very long time now. So, that is Gandhar in the Cambay basin. For that we have a tie up with the Equinor. They have their project Northern Lights in the North Sea.

Edited excerpts: In an interview, Shukla spoke about how firms are adopting automation, disruptive role of platforms like ChatGPT and more. Edited excerpts: We heard about Automation Anywhere\u2019s IPO plan. Has it been delayed? We are growing fast, creating a very compelling product on cloud automation, which is being used by more than 70% of our new customers. We are very excited with the business we\u2019re building and will look for an opportune moment to float our public offer. Your key markets are North America and Europe but have you seen faster growth in India after the covid-19 led digital transformation wave? India has been a great source of talent and innovation for us and it continues to be. We are strengthening our place in India with two R&D centres in Bengaluru and Baroda. We are seeing growing interest from local enterprises in adopting automation. With well-known brands in India scaling their businesses, they find a need for speed and scale. We are seeing some large private banks, oil and gas companies adopting and scaling automation, and are seeing traction in healthcare, telecom, and manufacturing in India, and a great deal of interest from governments. Has the economic crisis impacted the adoption of automation? Because of speed and scale automation is the solution to turn to in a time of recession and inflationary pressures, as we all are experiencing. I think you will have seen this in past recessions as well. You will see even faster adoption of automation across all enterprises. What are your plans in India in terms of hiring and investments? We are strengthening our teams in India:R&D and to serve enterprises. Over 50% of our global workforce sits in India and that speaks for itself. The team has led the work on some of the most cutting-edge products we have launched recently. Many firms are working on integrating ChatGPT into their services. Will it become mainstream soon? Most technologies start as entertainment initially. Technologies that have capabilities like ChatGPT will become more and more mainstream. ChatGPT is an example of where we are going and what\u2019s to come. AI can be a great tool to answer questions. I think one of the things we as humans will have to get better at is thinking about what are the right questions.

JSW Steel Ltd\u2019s net profit plunged 90% in the December quarter from a year earlier, and the earnings also trailed analysts\u2019 expectations. However, Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and group chief financial officer, said a sequential analysis would do more justice to the financial performance. \u201cThe results have to be seen in the context of Q3 versus Q2, rather than year-on-year because last fiscal year was an aberration,\" he said in an interview. \u201cLast year, steel prices were very high, and raw material price increase took some time to catch up, resulting in exceptionally robust margins posted by steel companies. However, the current year saw steel price corrections post-May, and margins also got normalized.\"  \u201cThe results have to be seen in the context of Q3 versus Q2, rather than year-on-year because last fiscal year was an aberration,\" he said in an interview. \u201cLast year, steel prices were very high, and raw material price increase took some time to catch up, resulting in exceptionally robust margins posted by steel companies. However, the current year saw steel price corrections post-May, and margins also got normalized.\"  \u201cWe have booked inventory losses in Q1 and Q2 of this fiscal year, and added to that, the rupee has depreciated from 75 to 82 to a dollar. Therefore, a quarter-on-quarter comparison will be appropriate,\" he added.  After reporting a loss of  \u20b9915 crore in the September quarter, the company posted a net profit of  \u20b9474 crore in Q3 compared to  \u20b94,516 crore a year earlier. \u201cIt is a big turnaround with a swing of almost  \u20b91,400 crore,\" Rao said.  The sequential rise was helped by the highest-ever production for JSW Steel, besides a bigger share of business in the automotive sector at 33% on the back of record domestic vehicle sales. Steel dispatches to makers of tinplate, appliances, and wind and solar energy have also increased.  Nevertheless, despite good domestic volumes, JSW Steel\u2019s inventories rose to 180,000 tonnes in Q3, primarily due to a steep drop in exports, which fell by 32% and accounted for 7% of production. Consequently, total sales volume was lower by 2% sequentially.  Rao said JSW Steel\u2019s financial turnaround on a sequential basis was made possible by a reduction in costs by  \u20b97,900 per tonne, which improved earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) per tonne from  \u20b93,460 in Q2 to  \u20b98,150 in Q3. The performance of its units also improved compared to Q2 from  \u20b910 crore to  \u20b9517 crore, resulting in consolidated Ebitda rising to  \u20b94,547 crore, he added. Rao expects steel demand to stay robust in Q4, as is normally the case in the last quarter of a financial year. The auto sector typically sees an uptick in sales in Q4, compared to Q3, and state governments also have more budgets. That apart, higher agriculture-related capex and increased activities for residential real estate would result in more demand for construction equipment as well as compressors, textile machinery, paper machinery, and wagon and locomotive manufacturing, which will boost demand for steel, he added.  Steel demand in Q3 was 30 million tonnes, which Rao expects to grow by two million tonnes in Q4, taking total demand to 118 mt for FY23, up 11%. Exports may also improve due to the rollback of duty in November and the easing of covid policy in China, resulting in the restocking of material globally.  \u201cPrices have become attractive for exports, and removal of export duty will help us compete in international markets,\" Rao said. Indian steel prices are at a 6% discount to imports, which may lead to price hikes for domestic steel.  Rao, however, said commodity prices would remain range bound in 2023. \u201cThe rate hike cycle in the global economy is likely to continue though the pace may reduce. Inflation in Europe and the US is very high, and inflation targeting remains at 2%. Debt-to-GDP ratio in many countries is also very high, and so we are not very optimistic about global demand recovery,\" said Rao.  The only area for all the triggers is from China opening up. \u201cCommentary coming is that the Chinese government is more focused on consumption-led growth than investment-led growth. Prices have improved in China and Europe, in the US, too, compared to November; however, they are still down from the highs in March-April,\" Rao added.  With raw material prices rising from the lows in November, Rao said coal and iron ore prices would not sustain. Most steel companies have announced capex and expansion plans to meet demand in the domestic market. JSW Steel, too, is increasing capacity by 10mt. Out of the capex allocation of  \u20b949,000 crore,  \u20b915,000 crore will be spent in FY23, and  \u20b934,000 crore over the next two years, said Rao.  Meanwhile, JSW Steel is scouting for more iron ore mines and will participate in auctions. It is investing in iron ore beneficiation plants in Odisha and slurry pipelines to cut the cost of transportation to ports. Rao said JSW Steel\u2019s units would perform better in the March quarter. He said carrying forward of coking coal inventory from Q3 to Q4 will ensure that there won\u2019t be any impact of the current spike in coking coal prices.","scraped_date":"2023-01-23"}

Globally, they may settle down only after the second quarter of the new fiscal year. \u201cDomestic demand, though, is huge in India, especially in locations like Goa, Rajasthan and Kashmir. Even city hotels are exhibiting high prices and the domestic demand, both tourism and business-linked, will continue to stay high,\" said Menon. Fairfax-owned Thomas Cook India was earlier focused heavily on European travel in terms of international outbound leisure tourism, but today, Asia and domestic travel dominate its business, with Europe re-emerging and the US expected to re-emerge later. Menon is confident that for long-haul travel too, this year will be better than last when it suffered due to visa issues, capacity caps and high airfares. \u201cCovid changed the way we viewed the customer. We value them much more than we did before. There is a so-called \u201cnew customer\" who had never transacted with us before. We discovered a younger generation approaching us, and this was partly aided by the fact that we updated our technology and made it an omni-channel approach,\" added Menon. Earlier, only about 4% of the company\u2019s transactions happened digitally. Today, that number has grown to 14%. It intends to take these up to 35%. India\u2019s presidency of the G20 could also add to hotel demand, for which the company is providing services to the government. While Menon did not comment on how much he expects the government to spend, industry estimates peg it at  \u20b9900-1,200 crore.","scraped_date":"2023-01-23"}

Edited excerpts: MUMBAI :Authentic Brands Group, the world\u2019s second-largest brand owner and licensor globally after Walt Disney, sees India as a significant market for licensing its brands, including Reebok, Brooks Brothers, Nautica, and Forever21, to retailers. The group is scouting for more partners across retail, wholesale and manufacturers and is hoping to collaborate and take some Indian brands to global markets, too, said Henry Stupp, president of India and EMEA at Authentic Brands. In an interview, he spoke about opening an office in India and why it\u2019s an exciting market. Edited excerpts: Are you looking at opening an office in India? Are you looking at opening an office in India? Yes, very soon, probably within the year. The idea is to always identify the best-in-class partners, whether they\u2019re wholesalers, manufacturers or retailers. And once they\u2019re identified, we have to remain engaged constantly. We want to understand their business. We want to be the connective tissue, bringing a wholesaler to a retailer and introducing the retailers to our licensing partners. You just can\u2019t do that remotely. You have to be in the markets, and we\u2019re seeing a lot of success in putting in-country managers and country teams in certain markets. And dotting the i\u2019s and crossing the t\u2019s has been a very, very effective way of working. What kind of opportunity do you see here? We have about 15 partners in India, and are still in the early stages. While these are some exceptional partners, we need to do a lot more. We probably have tripled the number of partners in 12 months, but many of our brands still haven\u2019t been licensed. We\u2019re still in the process of identifying the right partners, whether they\u2019re wholesalers or retailers. And so I\u2019m spending more and more time here. This is my third trip here in the last 12 months, and I\u2019ll be back again in March. Identifying the right brands or collaboration partners is going to be critical to our India strategy. The demand for Indian fashion is increasing, and we\u2019re seeing it. I think, eventually, it\u2019s going to break through into many other global markets. So when we look at our brands like Brooks Brothers, there should be an Indian component. It should be designed in India and probably produced here. And then there\u2019s the whole opportunity of doing Indian collaborations with our brands to make them relevant for each market. That\u2019s sort of the strategy that we\u2019re planning on following. And then, to be honest with you, I think that in time, there will be brand opportunities that will come out of India that we\u2019ll want to introduce to other parts of the world. Will you be looking to take Indian brands to other markets? Absolutely. I have a very simple belief that a good product should be accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime. What is your view of manufacturers in India? I\u2019ve watched the evolution of the manufacturing base in India get better and better each and every year. I have not left without being pleasantly surprised on my last few trips about the quality of the merchandise being produced, and I\u2019m excited to see where you\u2019re going to be in the coming years. Certainly, the government is encouraging domestic manufacturing through some of the new importation rules that have been put in place that should allow the domestic industry to catch up to other markets. You have the technology, labour force, and natural resources. It\u2019s just a matter of time before I think that it will continue to grow. The interesting thing is, will the rise of domestic manufacturing and the affluence associated with it result in more Indian goods remaining in India, which is what we saw in China. For Authentic Brands, where does India stand? India is an emerging market for us, and that\u2019s why I felt that it was an incredible opportunity for me to be able to work in India and take a view of working on developing a strategy that\u2019s unique for India. There are also important lessons to be learnt from other emerging markets, including the Gulf, North Africa, and Sub-Saharan East Africa, and shared between all these different regions. I look at what Authentic Brands is doing in Turkey, which has some of the most amazing dynamic operators and is able to take good lessons learned and introduce them to other markets. It\u2019s actually one of the more exciting parts of my job. And how big is the luxury brands market in India? Data says it\u2019s about $5 billion today in retail value, and it\u2019s anticipated to grow 10 to 12% a year, which is slightly ahead of your GDP, which I think is running about 8% right now. So it is a very, very resilient category. It\u2019s highly sought after, and in the overall scheme of things, even though $5 billion is a significant market, it\u2019s still a small piece, and that\u2019s why it retains such resiliency. Who are your big partners in India? Reliance, Aditya Birla, Myntra, Flipkart, and KG Denim are a few of our partners here. I believe we have a good group of partners. What is your view on the regulatory environment regarding the retail sector in India? Every country has challenges in one way or another. I think that India is moving in a direction to address it. What is really going to drive changes in legislation is how technology is going to lead to more organised retail, where right now, it\u2019s still highly unstructured. I think the current statistics show that only 10% of Indian retail is structured. That will change, and we\u2019ve seen that happen in North Africa, East Africa, and many other markets. Technologies will lead to consolidation as it brings better value to the consumers, so that\u2019s a natural evolution in all markets. And technology will drive it towards fewer, bigger and better retailers. How big is counterfeit as a challenge? It\u2019s obviously a very big challenge, one we deal with on a daily basis. It\u2019s also true that when you\u2019re not being knocked off, you know, where\u2019s your brand heat? Having said that, I don\u2019t personally know what size it is. I don\u2019t think it is material for our portfolio, particularly in this part of the world where we\u2019re still growing, you know. We have recently come across counterfeit merchandise of Reebok, Nautica, Brooks Brother, as well as Juicy Couture, and so we are dealing with it. As the brand heat grows, we see more and more counterfeits in the market. The easiest way of addressing counterfeit merchandise is to make sure that you have a good supply chain. That is the number one way of stopping it. Have supply chains improved now after the pandemic? The pandemic led to shortfalls in the lack of availability of certain components, but that was not just for our industry. Look at the automotive industry in Europe; you can\u2019t get computer chips. They\u2019re selling cars now in Europe, where you have to come back six months later to get your navigation system installed. We faced unavailability of components, factory closures etc. Now the impact on fuel prices is something that\u2019s going to be sitting right in front of us. With China reopening, it is going to lead to increasing capacity, which is good news, but it is also going to drive up fuel demands because China being shut down really kept fuel prices, on a global basis, largely under control.","scraped_date":"2023-01-23"}

NEW DELHI :Cummins India, a maker of diesel internal combustion engines, believes that while alternative fuel technologies such as hydrogen-IC engines and fuel cells could help the trucking sector go green, they won\u2019t be adopted widely until the next decade due to significant infrastructure requirements. The company believes that diesel engines and flex-fuel options that use biofuels, blended ethanol and natural gas will remain dominant as India transitions to fully green technologies. The company believes that diesel engines and flex-fuel options that use biofuels, blended ethanol and natural gas will remain dominant as India transitions to fully green technologies. The company is investing in building electrolyzers in India to generate green hydrogen for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and fuel-agnostic platforms for Indian commercial vehicle makers as they transition to emissions-free technologies between 2040 and 2050, Ashwath Ram, managing director of Cummins India, said in an interview. \u201cNinety-nine per cent of everything we sell in India today is diesel-powered, and about 1% utilizes natural gas. Between now and 2030, we think that the CNG, LNG, biofuels and blended ethanol fuels could probably get to as high as 15%, and about 85% will continue to be with diesel, but between 2030 and 2040, we think the percentage of all those other fuels, including hydrogen, can go to 30%, and then in the 2040 to 2050 timeframe, we think we can get to 50:50. For a country like India, the time between 2050 and 2070, which is when we have committed to achieving net zero-carbon emissions, the remaining portion will also convert to green fuels\", Ram said. \u201cThe way we think about destination-zero is that it will not be a cliff event but a gradual journey towards zero. And our concern is what we can do today. In this decade, we are cleaning up the technologies. We are making our products more efficient and introducing several other platforms, such as LNG, CNG, biofuels and blended mixes with ethanol.\" According to Ram, it will take at least two decades for hydrogen-powered vehicles, particularly fuel cells, to gain wide adoption in India due to challenges such as lack of green hydrogen availability and storage, high cost of hydrogen IC-engines and fuel cell technologies, and regulatory bottlenecks. \u201cHydrogen storage and transport regulation in India says that 350 bar is the maximum pressure at which tanks can be used for hydrogen transportation. Around the world, the standard has already moved to 700 bar. When you move from 350 to 700 bar, you can store double the amount of fuel because it\u2019s pressurized,\" Ram said. \u201cSo this regulation will have to change, and it will, as the world has already changed to that standard.\" Secondly, storage tanks for hydrogen are currently not built locally. \u201cThese tanks are built from carbon fibre. We need a supply of carbon fibre, which is produced by only a few companies in the world. It\u2019s not produced in bulk volume in India as of now; so that infrastructure needs to be set up,\" Ram said. Additionally, hydrogen production for mobility will have to ramp up. \u201cToday, most of the hydrogen produced is used up in the petrochemical processes to produce ammonia and decarbonize steel. So, where is hydrogen available for use in the mobility space? The industry will have to start generating excess hydrogen just for mobility. Besides this, all hydrogen being produced today is what\u2019s called grey or blue hydrogen right out of the petrochemical process. It\u2019s not green hydrogen, which solves only part of the problem of zero-emissions, not the complete problem\", Ram said, adding that Cummins is also setting up electrolyzers in India to produce green hydrogen. Lastly, hydrogen-IC engines currently cost roughly twice that of a comparable diesel engine, while a fuel cell vehicle comes with nearly five times the cost today. \u201cThere is a huge catch-up between where fuel cells are from a cost perspective, to where hydrogen ICE can get to quickly. We see that hydrogen-IC engine is a strong bridge for India and can be a dominant technology for 25-30 years before fuel cells become viable,\" he said.","scraped_date":"2023-01-23"}

NEW DELHI :The prolonged air travel disruption caused by the pandemic has taken a heavy toll on airlines, especially two of India\u2019s oldest budget carriers, Go First and SpiceJet, which lacked the funds to weather a long crisis period. Go First and SpiceJet started flight operations in 2005, followed by the market leader, IndiGo, in 2006.

Clearly, SpiceJet and Go First have been affected and need fund infusion to maintain course,\" an industry executive said, requesting anonymity. Supply chain challenges further compounded their struggles last year, leading to delayed delivery of engines and aircraft parts. Go First, for example, only received its 55th fuel-efficient Airbus A320neo aircraft after a delay of almost one-and-a-half months. Despite having a fleet of 60 planes, including 5 Airbus 320ceos, 20-25 of its planes were grounded in the last three months due to engine and parts shortages. \u201cPratt & Whitney had provided 17 serviceable engines in December, and we could make eight aircraft serviceable. Similarly, we expect 20 serviceable engines by February-March,\" said a Go First spokesperson. \u201cWe are in the process of taking delivery of eight new aircraft from Airbus from January to June, which will take the fleet to 68.\" The spokesperson said the airline would add a new aircraft in two days. While Go First has so far availed loans of around  \u20b9590 crore under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme 3.0 (ECLGS), its proposed  \u20b93,600-crore initial public offering has been delayed. The airline is evaluating the opportunity for an IPO from time to time and will be ready to take steps, the spokesperson said. SpiceJet has also been experiencing a host of issues, including delays in the induction of MAX aircraft and fundraising. The separation and stake sale in its profitable arm SpiceXpress has faced several hurdles. \u201cThey are trying to raise capital by hiving off cargo and possibly raising funds from strategic and financial investors. Without funding, frankly, there is no game, and they realise it,\" Kapil Kaul, chief executive and director of Centre for Aviation, said. Out of its fleet of 68 aircraft, 25 have not been in operation for seven days, leaving an operational fleet of 43 planes. Lack of funds is also impacting the airline\u2019s ability to expand operations. In January-November, SpiceJet flight departures stood at 82,512, down 47% from the same period in 2019, while for Go First, flight departures fell 22.5% to 66,740 flights. IndiGo departures in the same period were at 452,798 flights, up 6% from 2019. For Vistara, flight departures in the period were 48% more than in 2019, or pre-covid levels at 72,615 departures. 2023 will be a year of intense competition between IndiGo and the Tata-run Air India group airlines. However, the situation will be even more crucial for SpiceJet and Go First to accelerate their fund infusion process, an aviation industry analyst said, requesting anonymity.","scraped_date":"2023-01-23"}

The software giant is heading into its second fiscal quarter earnings report on Tuesday facing a slumping PC market, a slowing corporate software market and even unclear demand for its once-hot cloud computing services.  Microsoft\u2019s dim forecast three months ago gave investors an early heads-up, and its plan to join other big techs in a recent layoff wave seemed to drive the point home further. \u201cWe will have to do more with less,\" Chief Executive Satya Nadella told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, before the company announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs from its payroll.  That would appear to set a low bar for the coming report. Analysts estimate that Microsoft\u2019s revenue for the December quarter grew only 2.7% year over year to $53.1 billion\u2014the company\u2019s lowest growth rate in nearly six years. Growth for the company\u2019s crucial Azure public cloud service is expected to hit a record low 30.5% year over year\u2014a deceleration of nearly 5 percentage points from the September quarter.  Revenue in the personal-computing segment that includes the Windows business is expected to slide 14% year over year\u2014a sharp reversal from the 15% growth logged in the previous year\u2019s December quarter, when the company was still benefiting from the pandemic-induced PC sales boom.MINT PREMIUMSee All\n  Microsoft\u2019s forecast for the March quarter and its outlook for the rest of the year will prove essential. Wall Street expects growth to pick back up in the second half of the calendar year. More crucially, Microsoft is expected to maintain annual operating margins above 40%\u2014the highest among the big tech peers including Apple, Amazon.com and the parent companies of Google and Facebook. Wall Street\u2019s projected operating margin of about 41% for Microsoft in calendar year 2023 is nearly 5 percentage points higher than what the company averaged over the five-year period running from 2017 to 2021 and is a much larger margin improvement than what the other four big techs are expected to show over the same period. Can the company pull that off? Maybe. Corporate tech officers are indeed cutting back their spending plans; Gartner projected that worldwide IT spending will grow 2.4% this year\u2014less than half the growth rate the market research firm predicted three months ago. Microsoft is still in a prime position given that it runs the second-largest public cloud service and owns many of the software tools and applications that are still central to business life. A recent survey by Morgan Stanley found that 38% of chief information officers rank Microsoft\u2019s Azure as their preferred cloud provider, compared with 31% for Amazon\u2019s larger AWS service. But Microsoft still has a lot of exposure to the PC market, which is in free fall. IDC reported earlier this month that PC unit sales slid 28% year over year in the fourth quarter\u2014the biggest drop that the market research firm has seen in years\u2014and doesn\u2019t expect recovery for the industry until 2024. Analyst John DiFucci of Guggenheim downgraded Microsoft to a sell rating on Jan. 17, citing both the PC slowdown and Microsoft\u2019s strong exposure to small businesses, which he says \u201ctypically fare worse than enterprises in a macro slowdown.\" Even cutting 10,000 workers might have a limited impact. That is only one-quarter of the employees Microsoft added in the fiscal year that ended in June 2022, which included the company\u2019s acquisition of Nuance Communications. In his email to employees announcing the layoffs, Mr. Nadella made clear that \u201cwe will continue to invest in strategic areas for our future,\" which includes the adoption of potentially expensive AI technology like ChatGPT across the company\u2019s products. Microsoft\u2019s highly successful transition into a cloudcentric company has deservedly earned it the faith of investors. Its ability to maintain high margins in the face of a possible recession will test that faith.

Peter and Nancy Rosalez found out in November they were eligible for up to $25,000 in government money to keep from losing their house to foreclosure.  But their mortgage company had gotten permission to foreclose on their Middletown, Ohio, home and was about to sell it. The money sat unused while an auction of the home went forward.  But their mortgage company had gotten permission to foreclose on their Middletown, Ohio, home and was about to sell it. The money sat unused while an auction of the home went forward.  \u201cThe mental anguish we\u2019ve been through with this house and trying to save this house\u2014it\u2019s just been ridiculous,\" Mrs. Rosalez said.  The federal government allocated funds for distressed homeowners as part of its expansive efforts to help Americans cope with the pandemic\u2019s financial strains. Unlike some other stimulus programs, such as checks mailed to individuals, this money moved slowly.  The nearly $10 billion Homeowner Assistance Fund was administered through the U.S. Treasury Department, but relied heavily on individual states to set up programs to distribute aid. Some were slow to get up and running. Others struggled with a backlog of applications. For homeowners, getting money before the foreclosure went through could be a race against time.  The money ultimately came through for Mr. and Mrs. Rosalez, but it came down to the wire. Expecting to be forced out of their home, the couple had packed up their belongings.  \u201cThe homeowner shouldn\u2019t be fighting on two battlefronts,\" said Jim Kowalski Jr., chief executive officer of Florida\u2019s Jacksonville Area Legal Aid Inc. That was common during the previous financial crisis, when millions lost their homes, he said. \u201cYou learned this lesson.\"MINT PREMIUMSee All\n  The fund doled out about $2 billion to more than 150,000 households through the end of September, according to the National Council of State Housing Agencies, a trade group. The money serves a narrow slice of the population: There were some 324,000 foreclosure filings last year, below prepandemic norms but more than double 2021, according to real-estate data firm Attom. The funds were made available to homeowners who experienced pandemic-related hardships and whose household incomes were below a certain threshold. Most states gave the money as grants. About 200 homeowners have complained about the program through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s complaint portal, including a handful about foreclosures moving forward while they were waiting on assistance. CFPB warned in March that foreclosing on a borrower who has a pending assistance application \u201cwill merit increased scrutiny.\" Government officials, as well as representatives of mortgage companies and states, said the assistance program has picked up speed, particularly in recent months, and everyone is working together. Servicers benefit more from taking the money than taking the home in a foreclosure, they said. The program \u201chas already provided much-needed assistance in all fifty states to over a hundred thousand low-income families,\" said Gene Sperling, who coordinates the rollout of the Biden administration\u2019s 2021 relief package, in a statement. Servicers must pause foreclosure proceedings for 60 days when a homeowner with a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loan applies for funds. But they don\u2019t have to do so for Department of Veterans Affairs loans and other government-backed mortgages. A group of federal agencies urged servicers to halt foreclosures for pending applications in such cases but stopped short of requiring it. Mr. and Mrs. Rosalez had paused payments on their VA mortgage in 2021 under a Covid forbearance program. Conversations about a loan modification with their mortgage servicer, a unit of MidFirst Bank, didn\u2019t result in a deal, according to Stephanie Moes, their legal aid attorney. The bank filed to foreclose in early August, and a court granted the request the next month. The couple filed an application in early October to Save the Dream, the Ohio program run by the state\u2019s housing-finance agency to distribute homeowner aid. They learned they were eligible for the program in November, just before a scheduled sheriff\u2019s sale of the house. Mrs. Rosalez emailed their eligibility letter to the bank. The sale went ahead and the bank was the winning bidder, which would allow it to evict the homeowners. In late December, Mrs. Rosalez called the bank\u2019s law firm. \u201cIf you have a heart, please reinstate us and let us get all this right,\" she said in a message. After The Wall Street Journal contacted MidFirst in early January, the bank asked the court to rescind the foreclosure, which was approved. A spokeswoman for the Ohio Housing Finance Agency said funds are being applied to reinstate their mortgage and cover up to six months of future payments. \u201cOnce we learn someone has been approved for HAF, our policy is to take action immediately, including as appropriate initiating the process to rescind foreclosure,\" a spokeswoman for MidFirst said. Defenders of the program say states like New York and Texas are running smoothly. That isn\u2019t the case everywhere, though. William Steinwedel, an attorney at Maryland Legal Aid Bureau, said one of his clients lost his home during a monthslong wait for assistance. In New Mexico, some homeowners are waiting months just to receive confirmation that their applications have been received, according to Eric Sutton, an attorney at the Albuquerque nonprofit United South Broadway Corp. \u201cThere are some states that are taking an alarming amount of time,\" said Stacey Tutt, an attorney who coordinates homeowner assistance at the National Housing Law Project. Homeowners who get approved after a lengthy delay might find their unpaid debt has gone up meanwhile, forcing them to use more assistance money to get their loans back on track, Ms. Tutt said. Because the fund has a fixed amount of money, that means less for other applicants. Some haven\u2019t been able to use the money at all. Christopher Elia started the process for homeowner assistance on his Orange Park, Fla., home in April, soon after his mortgage company filed for foreclosure. \u201cI stressed every day,\" Mr. Elia said. \u201cI was afraid to answer the door.\" In October, he was approved for up to $50,000 in assistance. But because of missed payments and the servicer\u2019s attorney fees, he owed more than $54,000 to reinstate the loan. Mr. Elia said he wasn\u2019t able to come up with the additional money. The $50,000 went unused. Marissa Vetter, Mr. Elia\u2019s housing counselor at Jacksonville Area Legal Aid, said she believes he could have used the assistance money if the unpaid debt hadn\u2019t ticked higher while Mr. Elia waited. A spokeswoman for Florida\u2019s Department of Economic Opportunity, which administers the state program, said Mr. Elia took three months to finish his application, delaying the process. Mr. Elia said he submitted his initial application promptly, but additional requests from the state delayed its completion. Weeks would pass in between requests, but he provided information as soon as he could, he said. The spokeswoman for the Florida agency defended its handling of aid applications, saying the state \u201cstretched every available dollar to serve as many homeowners as possible.\" To reinstate his loan, Mr. Elia agreed with the servicer to extend the repayment term from 14 years to 40 with a higher monthly payment. He is hoping to get money from the program to cover some payments on the modified loan. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cooper Group Inc., the parent company of Mr. Elia\u2019s mortgage servicer, RightPath, said the company continues to work with him. Mr. Kowalski, of Jacksonville Area Legal Aid, wrote a letter to federal regulators in November hoping to draw attention to Mr. Elia\u2019s case. \u201cYou must do better,\" he wrote.

The office has deployed the 1989 law at the same time the Labor Department presses a workplace safety investigation of Amazon that has already led to several citations.  The Labor Department in December cited Amazon at six of its warehouses for not adequately reporting injuries and this week cited three company facilities, saying workers were exposed to ergonomic or equipment hazards.  Amazon has said it intends to appeal the citations. The company also said it never intentionally misrepresented its safety record.

An Amazon unit last month challenged the subpoena and related subpoenas in federal court in Seattle. \u201cIt is difficult to understand how a safety inquiry could plausibly be shoehorned into a Firrea investigation,\" Zainab Ahmad, a partner at outside counsel Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, wrote in a letter to government lawyers that is included with court papers. \u201cFirrea addresses financial fraud, not employee safety,\" Ms. Ahmad added, calling the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s legal theory \u201cextremely tenuous\" and \u201cunprecedented.\" The office is seeking a range of documents on Amazon\u2019s labor practices, including internal communications touching on policies around workplace productivity.

Amazon in court papers in the case in Seattle said the information demands are \u201cunrealistic\" and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office stretched to assert jurisdiction under Firrea. While the law was meant to target insiders who looted savings-and-loan institutions, it has been applied in novel ways by government lawyers, said Robert Giuffra, a partner at the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP who has worked on Firrea-related litigation. \u201cThe Justice Department has a history of misusing the Firrea statute and stretching it far beyond its intended purposes,\" he added. Firrea emerged as a \u201csuperweapon\" for the U.S. Justice Department following the 2008 financial crisis, when it was used to bring cases against banks themselves, said Brian Feldman, a lawyer formerly with the civil fraud unit of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan who now is in private practice at Harter Secrest & Emery LLP. Mr. Feldman, who worked on Firrea-related cases during his time in the office, said that while the Amazon case involves a \u201cnovel set of circumstances,\" Firrea is written to allow the government to tackle a variety of fraud affecting banks.

The Justice Department is investigating conduct at the Abbott Laboratories infant-formula plant in Sturgis, Mich., that led to its shutdown last year and worsened a nationwide formula shortage, people familiar with the matter said.  Attorneys with the Justice Department\u2019s consumer-protection branch are conducting the criminal investigation, the people said.  Attorneys with the Justice Department\u2019s consumer-protection branch are conducting the criminal investigation, the people said.  The branch, which has criminal as well as civil authority, was involved last year in a settlement with Abbott that allowed its Sturgis plant to resume operations after Food and Drug Administration inspectors found a potentially deadly bacteria there.  \u201cThe DOJ has informed us of its investigation, and we\u2019re cooperating fully,\" an Abbott spokesman said.  The investigation signals further scrutiny of Abbott\u2019s operation of the plant, a major source of baby formula in the U.S., and perhaps of the more than $4 billion formula industry.  The Justice Department in the past decade has investigated numerous food companies that have shipped contaminated products that resulted in illnesses or deaths.  Several have led to criminal prosecutions under the 1938 Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of companies or executives involved in producing goods from ice cream to peanut butter. The law allows government officials to prosecute entities or individuals who introduce adulterated food into interstate commerce.  In many recent cases, DOJ has been able to successfully prosecute defendants on misdemeanor charges for introducing contaminated food into the market even without proof that officials acted with criminal intent, according to Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who represents victims of food-borne illnesses.MINT PREMIUMSee All\n  Abbott, based outside Chicago, is one of the biggest manufacturers of baby formula. The company sells Similac, among other brands. Last January, FDA inspectors found bacteria at the plant after receiving reports of babies who drank the company\u2019s formula and became sick. The inspectors also found standing water, damage to drying equipment and defects in the seams of formula cans, among other problems at the Sturgis plant. Federal officials couldn\u2019t conclusively link the bacteria at the plant to the infants\u2019 illnesses, however. Abbott has said genetic sequencing of the bacteria in the sick babies didn\u2019t match the strains found at the plant. Abbott temporarily halted production at the Sturgis factory in February, and recalled baby formula made at the plant. The moves contributed to an infant formula shortage that sent parents and federal officials scrambling for months. To bolster supplies, the federal government waived regulatory requirements and tariffs to allow more foreign formula into the country, and the White House organized planes to fly baby formula to the U.S. Abbott last May signed a legal agreement, called a consent decree, detailing the steps it would need to take to reopen the plant. In the complaint accompanying that civil agreement, the Justice Department said Abbott and several of its employees had caused \u201cadulterated food\" to enter interstate commerce. \u201cOngoing inadequacies in manufacturing conditions and practices at Defendants\u2019 facilities demonstrate that Defendants have been unwilling or unable to implement sustainable corrective actions to ensure the safety and quality of food manufactured for infants, a consumer group particularly vulnerable to foodborne pathogens,\" the department said in the complaint. Also in May, Abbott Chief Executive Robert Ford apologized for the company\u2019s role in the formula shortage, and said it was making investments to avoid a repeat. The company reopened the plant in June. Limited formula supplies continued into September, however, when adults in roughly one-third of households with infant children on formula had trouble getting it, according U.S. Census Bureau data. By October, in-stock rates had stabilized close to where they had been before the Sturgis plant shut down, federal officials have said. In 2020, the Justice Department filed criminal charges against Texas ice-cream company Blue Bell Creameries LP and its former chief executive following an investigation into a listeria outbreak tied to three deaths and other illnesses. Blue Bell agreed to pay $19 million and plead guilty to two misdemeanor charges related to shipments of contaminated ice cream. The former chief executive has pleaded not guilty to the charges. That same year, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. said it would pay a record $25 million to resolve criminal charges stemming from a series of foodborne-illness outbreaks involving its restaurants that sickened more than 1,000 people. In 2015, Stewart Parnell, the former owner of Peanut Corp. of America, was sentenced to 28 years in prison a year after being convicted of presiding over a coverup that led to a deadly salmonella outbreak. \u00a0","scraped_date":"2023-01-23"}

Google parent Alphabet Inc. followed with plans of its own to shrink its workforce. Wall Street has been slashing earnings estimates for months for the tech sector, which is projected to be the biggest drag on S&P 500 profits in the fourth quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. The danger for investors, however, is that analysts still prove too optimistic, with demand for the industry\u2019s products crumbling as the economy cools. \u201cTech is driving a lot of the overall earnings recession that we\u2019re seeing in the S&P,\" said Michael Casper, an equity strategist with Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cWhile there\u2019s a lot baked in, depending on if this recession does emerge and how badly it occurs, there is certainly some negative revision risk for the sector still.\" Firms including Texas Instruments Inc., Lam Research Corp. and Intel Corp. also report next week. Apple Inc., Alphabet and other behemoths announce the week after. The group has huge sway over the path of the overall market, with info-tech accounting for more than 25% of the S&P 500\u2019s market capitalization. Fourth-quarter earnings for tech firms in the benchmark are projected to drop 9.2% from the same period a year earlier, the steepest slide since 2016, data compiled by BI show. The speed of the deterioration in sentiment is notable: Three months ago, Wall Street merely saw profits coming in flat. Revenue growth for these companies is fading relative to the past couple of years, when the pandemic and ensuing lockdowns supercharged sales for everything from digital services to personal computers and the components that power them. Higher costs are also squeezing profits. Valuation Concerns The concern, however, is that valuations are still far from cheap despite last year\u2019s 33% tumble in the Nasdaq 100. The gauge is priced at about 21 times profits projected over the next 12 months, compared with an average of 20.5 for the past decade, and further estimate cuts would only make it look more expensive. The multiple bottomed at 17.7 in 2020 and at 11.3 in 2011, in the wake of the recession that ended in 2009. Still, for Sameer Bhasin, principal at Value Point Capital, most of the bad news has been priced in. He anticipates that first-quarter profit estimates may have further to fall, but says some of the fears are overblown. \u201cTech isn\u2019t suffering from an industry demand issue, it\u2019s suffering more from a digestion of the excesses that were built in during the pandemic,\" he said. \u201cThere\u2019s money on the sidelines that is waiting to be put back into the sector.\" Analysts anticipate that tech profits will return to growth in the second half of the year, data compiled by BI show. That will make executives\u2019 outlooks for the full year all the more critical for stocks. As earnings roll in over the next few weeks, investors will have plenty of risks to monitor. Among them are the possibility that inflation proves to be more entrenched than many expect, as well as the effect of higher rates on profits, says Nick Getaz, a portfolio manager of the Franklin Rising Dividends Fund. \u201cMonetary policy has a lag and we\u2019re likely still in the window of that,\" he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the earnings impact you\u2019d expect to see from rate hikes.\" \u00a0 This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.","scraped_date":"2023-01-23"}

PAT grew by 8.4% QoQ from  \u20b971.2 crore to  \u20b977.2 crore with a margin of 66%,\" the company said in a statement. During Q3 FY23, the exchange logged electricity volumes of 23 BU, a growth of 9% QoQ, but down 2% YoY.  Trade volumes were impacted largely due to supply-side constraints, led by high prices of e-auction coal. REC (renewable energy certificates) volumes at 1.2 BU during the third quarter of FY2022-23 witnessed a de-growth of 68 per cent on a YoY basis as the year-ago period had exceptionally high REC volumes to fulfil the pent-up demand caused by stay on REC trading by APTEL for a period of 16 months, it stated. Overall volumes at the exchange was 24.2 BU during Q3 FY23, a 5% rise sequentially across market segments. However, volumes declined 12% YoY, because of power supply side constraints, high prices discovered during Q3 FY 2023 and high REC traded volumes during the quarter under review. In the quarter, price of e-auction coal continued to be high. While the quarterly average price premium declined from 293% in the second quarter of FY23 to 242% in the third, it was considerably higher compared to 35% for special forward e-auction price for the power sector in FY22. As a result, input cost for gencos continued to be high. Persistent high spot e-auction coal prices led to average clearing price in the day-ahead market at  \u20b94.56 in Q3 FY2023, while lower from  \u20b95.40 in the previous quarter, but still high to provide optimization potential for discoms and open access consumers, it said. Improving coal inventory and reduction in e-auction prices are expected to result in a decline in power prices on the exchange and provide further cost optimisation opportunities to discoms and open access consumers. This is expected to result in higher volumes on the exchange. IGX traded a total gas volumes of 24.42 million MMBtu during Q3 FY23, which was a 568% YoY increase. The growth was, largely, the result of the participation from major domestic gas producers and an increase in the number of participants. ","scraped_date":"2023-01-23"}

Elon Musk took the witness stand Friday to defend a 2018 tweet claiming he had lined up the financing to take Tesla private in a deal that never came close to happening. The tweet resulted in a $40 million settlement with securities regulators. It also led to a class-action lawsuit alleging he misled investors, pulling him into court for about a half hour Friday to deliver sworn testimony in front of a nine-person jury and a full room of media and other spectators. The tweet resulted in a $40 million settlement with securities regulators. It also led to a class-action lawsuit alleging he misled investors, pulling him into court for about a half hour Friday to deliver sworn testimony in front of a nine-person jury and a full room of media and other spectators. The trial was then adjourned for the weekend and Musk was told to return Monday to answer more questions. In his initial appearance on the stand, Musk defended his prolific tweeting as \u201cthe most democratic way\" to distribute information even while acknowledging constraints of Twitter's 280-character limit can make it difficult to make everything as clear as possible. \u201cI think you can absolutely be truthful (on Twitter),\" Musk asserted on the stand. \u201cBut can you be comprehensive? Of course not,\" Musk's latest headache stems from the inherent brevity on Twitter, a service that he has been running since completing his $44 billion purchase of it in October. The trial hinges on the question of whether a pair of tweets that Musk posted on Aug. 7, 2018, damaged Tesla shareholders during a 10-day period leading up to a Musk admission that the buyout he had envisioned wasn\u2019t going to happen. In the first of those those two 2018 tweets, Musk stated \u201cfunding secured\" for a what would have been a $72 billion buyout of Tesla at a time when the electric automaker was still grapping with production problems and was worth far less than it is now. Musk followed up a few hours later with another tweet suggesting a deal was imminent. After it became apparent that the money wasn't in place to take Tesla private, Musk stepped down as Tesla\u2019s chairman while remaining CEO as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission settlement, without acknowledging any wrongdoing. The impulsive billionaire came into court wearing a dark suit and tie on the third day of the civil trial in San Francisco that his lawyer unsuccessfully tried to move to Texas, where Tesla is now headquartered, on the premise that media coverage of his tumultuous takeover of Twitter had tainted the jury pool. The jury that was assembled earlier this week focused intently on Musk while he answered questions posed by Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer representing Tesla shareholders. At one point, Musk asked Porritt if he would speak closer to the microphone so he could hear him better. At other times, Musk craned his neck as he gazed around the courtroom. Musk, 51, said he cares \u201ca great deal\" about investors and also railed against short sellers who make investments that reward them when a company's stock price falls. He called short selling an \u201cevil\" practice that should be outlawed, denigrating those who profit from it as \u201ca bunch of sharks.\" When shown communications from Tesla investors urging him to curtail or completely stop his Twitter habit before the 2018 buyout tweet, Musk said he couldn't remember all those interactions from years ago, especially since he gets a \u201cNiagara Falls\" of emails. Even before Musk took the stand, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen had declared that the jurors can consider those two tweets to be false, leaving them to decide whether Musk deliberately deceived investors and whether his statements saddled them with losses. Musk has previously contended he entered into the SEC settlement under duress and maintained he believed he had locked up financial backing for a Tesla buyout during meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund. An expert on corporate buyouts hired by shareholder lawyers to study the events surrounding Musk's proposal to take Tesla private spent the bulk of his three hours on the stand Friday deriding the plan as an ill-conceived concept. \u201cThis proposal was an extreme outlier,\" said Guhan Subramanian, a Harvard University business and law professor for more than 20 years. \u201cIt was incoherent. It was illusory.\" In a lengthy cross examination that delayed Musk's appearance, a lawyer for Tesla's board of directors tried to undermine Subramanian's testimony by pointing out that it relied on graduate student assistance to review some of the material related to the August 2018 tweets. The lawyer, William Price, also noted Subramanian's $1,900-per-hour fee for compiling his report for the case. The trial over his Tesla tweets come at a time when Musk has been focusing on Twitter while also serving as the automaker's CEO and also remaining deeply involved in SpaceX, the rocket ship company he founded. Musk\u2019s leadership of Twitter \u2014 where he has gutted the staff and alienated users and advertisers \u2014 has proven unpopular among Tesla\u2019s current stockholders, who are worried he has been devoting less time steering the automaker at a time of intensifying competition. Those concerns contributed to a 65% decline in Tesla\u2019s stock last year that wiped out more than $700 billion in shareholder wealth \u2014 far more than the $14 billion swing in fortune that occurred between the company\u2019s high and low stock prices during the Aug. 7-17, 2018 period covered in the class-action lawsuit. Tesla\u2019s stock has split twice since then, making the $420 buyout price cited in his 2018 tweet worth $28 on adjusted basis now. The company's shares were trading around $133.42 Friday, down from the company\u2019s November 2021 split-adjusted peak of $414.50. After Musk dropped the idea of a Tesla buyout, the company overcame its production problems, resulting in a rapid upturn in car sales that caused its stock to soar and minted Musk as the world\u2019s richest person until he bought Twitter. Musk dropped from the top spot on the wealth list after the stock market\u2019s backlash to his handling of Twitter. When asked Friday about the challenges that Tesla faced in 2018, he recalled spending many nights sleeping at the automaker's California factory as he tried to keep the company afloat. \u201cThe sheer level of pain to make Tesla successful during that 2017, 2018 period was excruciating,\" he recalled.","scraped_date":"2023-01-23"}
