Kotak Mahindra Bank expects to grow its commercial banking book to  \u20b91 trillion next fiscal, driven by demand for commercial vehicles and equipment, and gold loans.  \u201cCurrently, the overall book size is at about  \u20b975,000 crore, and we can look at over  \u20b91 trillion in the coming fiscal (FY24),\" Manish Kothari, president and head of commercial banking at Kotak Mahindra Bank, said in an interview.  \u201cCurrently, the overall book size is at about  \u20b975,000 crore, and we can look at over  \u20b91 trillion in the coming fiscal (FY24),\" Manish Kothari, president and head of commercial banking at Kotak Mahindra Bank, said in an interview.  Kotak\u2019s commercial banking unit, comprising agriculture finance, tractor finance, commercial vehicles finance, construction equipment finance, microfinance and gold loans, accounted for 23% of its advances as of 31 March 2022. Kotak is optimistic about credit growth as the recovery in economic activity after the pandemic and the government\u2019s infrastructure spending have driven demand for loans for vehicles and construction equipment. The government\u2019s focus on clean water and sanitation, in addition to roads and highways, has also created new opportunities for the bank. The commercial vehicle industry is bouncing back after the pandemic and is likely to grow 25-27% in FY23, Kothari said. The bank, he said, would look to expand its commercial vehicle disbursements at 60%, faster than the overall industry.  \u201cWe are ramping up the small commercial vehicle business. The segment where we have a greater market share\u2014of close to 8-9%\u2014is in medium, heavy and light commercial vehicles,\" said Kothari, adding that the bank has about 3% market share in the small commercial vehicles space and is looking to double it in the next couple of years.  In the financing of commercial equipment, Kothari said the bank is ranked No. 3 in the business, although it is very difficult to get the data on the number of units sold because a lot of equipment is not registered. \u201cThis year, construction equipment should grow at anywhere 15-20%, and we will be in line with the growth of the industry,\" he said.  Given that the demand for commercial equipment is linked to growth in infrastructure, Kothari said that the government boost to the infrastructure space has been useful.  \u201cA significant amount of government spending continues to happen in the infrastructure space. More segments are opening up beyond roads and highways. I guess water is a space in which there is a significant investment,\" he said. As of 31 December, the aggregate size of its commercial vehicle and commercial equipment loan book stood at  \u20b925,814 crore, up 27% from last year.  Kothari said the bank is also looking to accelerate growth in its gold loan business. Currently, gold loans are available in about 500 branches, and the bank is putting the entire business model in place and aims to grow the book next year.  \u201cFrom February onwards, we will go to market and begin talking about the product. Not too many people are aware that Kotak has gold loans. So, we will look to build it to 2-2.5 times where we are right now,\" he said.  According to him, gold loans need clear infrastructure, and processes must be very different. The customer comes with the gold jewellery into the branch, and so branches need to have safe-keeping, a place for the customer to be attended to and an external valuer to come and value the gold, Kothari said. \u201cSo, that is a piece, which largely is in place now. We have covered a lot of branches in the last 12 months in terms of putting the infrastructure in place and will now look to accelerate,\" he said.","scraped_date":"2023-01-24"}

The government is likely to introduce amendments to Goods and Services Tax (GST) law through the Finance Bill, 2023, denying businesses credit for the taxes paid while procuring goods and services that they provide to the community under their corporate social responsibility (CSR) obligations. This would mean that the taxes that are part of the goods and services used in CSR activities cannot be adjusted against the company\u2019s overall GST liability, according to two persons aware about discussions in the Central government. \u201cThis would be a major change to the GST law,\" said one of the persons. The plan is to amend sections in the GST Act (16 and 17) dealing with input tax credit or ITC. This would mean that the taxes that are part of the goods and services used in CSR activities cannot be adjusted against the company\u2019s overall GST liability, according to two persons aware about discussions in the Central government. \u201cThis would be a major change to the GST law,\" said one of the persons. The plan is to amend sections in the GST Act (16 and 17) dealing with input tax credit or ITC. One of the cornerstones of GST is availability of credit to a business for the taxes paid on purchases so that tax applies only to the value addition at each stage of the supply chain and there is no tax on tax. However, credit for GST paid while procuring goods and services for meeting CSR obligations has been a grey area with different advance ruling authorities giving contradictory orders. This has warranted clearing the air through legislative amendments, said the first person quoted above. It is through the annual Finance Bill, changes in various tax laws such as Income Tax Act, Customs Act, CGST Act and IGST Acts are implemented. The advance ruling authorities in Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat and Kerala have examined the issue whether the taxes paid as part of CSR activities is \u201cin the course or furtherance of his business\"\u2014the criteria for credit to be available for taxes paid on purchases--and have given diametrically opposite views. While the Telangana State Authority for Advance Ruling and the Authority for Advance Ruling in Uttar Pradesh said that GST on inputs procured for CSR is available as credit, the authorities in Gujarat and Kerala ordered otherwise on this specific question, showed the orders that are available in the public domain. The Telangana State Authority for Advance Ruling noted in its 20 October 2022 order that CSR spending mandated under Companies Act is an expenditure made in the furtherance of the business. \u201cHence the tax paid on purchases made to meet the obligations under corporate social responsibility will be eligible for input tax credit under Central GST and State GST Acts,\" said the order. The UP Authority explained in its January 2020 ruling that CSR spending is not voluntary, but is a statutory obligation under company law and hence tax credit on it is not restricted. However, the Gujarat Authority for Advance Ruling in its August 2021 order explained that CSR activities are excluded from normal course of business and therefore not eligible for input tax credit. The move to specify in the CGST Act that input tax credit will not be available to businesses on CSR is relevant for large companies like Reliance Industries, TCS, Tata Sons, HDFC Bank Ltd. and ONGC, the highest CSR spenders as per official data. In FY21, Reliance Industries spent  \u20b9922 crores on CSR, followed by TCS with a spending of  \u20b9674 crore and Tata Sons with  \u20b9546 crores, while HDFC Bank Ltd. spent  \u20b9534 crores and ONGC Ltd. spent  \u20b9531 crores. India Inc. spent more than  \u20b925,700 crore on CSR in FY21. Spending on corporate social responsibility by the industry has seen a sharp jump in recent years, up from over  \u20b914,300 crore spent in FY17. In January 2021, the government gave effect to a penalty provision for defaulting on CSR spending obligation and allowed businesses to spend more than their obligation which could be adjusted against their future spending requirement. Companies with a net worth of  \u20b9500 crore or more, or a turnover of  \u20b91,000 crore or more, or net profit of  \u20b9five crore or more, are required to spend 2% of their average net profit of the preceding three years on CSR activities. Companies have to spend the amount computed in this way on CSR whether or not they get tax credits. The advantage of getting input tax credit is that it could be used to pay off at least part of the GST liability on the company\u2019s sales. Queries emailed to the spokesperson for the finance ministry and to the GST Council Secretariat on Friday seeking comments for the story remained unanswered at the time of publishing.","scraped_date":"2023-01-24"}

Shares in Juventus Football Club SpA fell sharply Monday after the club was docked 15 points in the Italian soccer league for accounting infringements.

In a statement late Friday, the Turin-based club said an Italian court had overruled a previous decision in Juventus\u2019s favor, resulting in a 15-point penalty in the Serie A league. Sporting Director Federico Cherubini will meanwhile be banned from working in Italian soccer for 16 months and possibly for longer on the international stage.  The penalty leaves Juventus in ninth place in the league, and its qualification for the lucrative European Champions League in doubt.  At 0942GMT, shares traded 6.1% lower at EUR0.31.  The court decision relates to the accounting of player transfers and capital gains, the club said, adding that it will appeal to the Italian Sport Guarantee Board.  The news comes on the heels of the resignation of Juventus chairman and businessman Andrea Agnelli late last year, along with the rest of the club\u2019s board, amid an accounting probe into the club by the Italian authorities.  Mr. Agnelli also stepped down last week from the boards of Agnelli-family holding company Exor NV\u2013which controls Juventus\u2013and auto maker Stellantis NV, in which Exor holds a minority stake.  Stellantis and Exor both face reputational risk from the Juventus affair, analyst Saima Hussain at Baader Helvea said in a research note. Mr. Agnelli will remain closely linked to Exor despite his stepping down as director, Ms. Hussain said. His departure from the Stellantis board meanwhile raises questions around the balance of power at the auto group between the Agnelli family and fellow shareholders the Peugeot family, the analyst said.  \u201cSuch issues do not look good at a time when ESG practices are increasingly important for investors and regulators,\" she noted.MINT PREMIUMSee All\n  This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text","scraped_date":"2023-01-24"}

Net subscriber additions were 5.3 million on-quarter. Given our expectations of no tariff hikes in FY24, we expect muted year for Jio,\" they added. Jio\u2019s net profit was at  \u20b94,638 crore in the December quarter, up 3% sequentially, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margins were at 52.2% up by 120 basis points sequentially, due to lower spectrum usage charges. The results of India\u2019s largest telco with 432.9 million subscribers showed ARPU was flattish at  \u20b9178, versus  \u20b9177 in the previous quarter. A section of brokerages, however, expect telcos to undertake tariff hikes in the coming quarters leading to higher profits and ARPU growth. \u201cA slowdown in revenue growth in the absence of tariff hikes and the significant investment on 5G network rollout makes us believe that tariff hikes will happen sooner than later. We stick to the view that 4G prepaid tariff hikes will happen in mid-2023,\" said IIFL Securities analysts in a note. \u201cUncertainty continues to loom around the next round of tariff hikes. But, we do expect 5G and tariff hike (whenever it happens) to drive up ARPU, leading to Ebidta growth,\" said analysts at Novuma Wealth Management. Airtel and Vodafone Idea are expected to announce results next month, but sector watchers do not expect a large uptick in ARPUs or profit despite Airtel raising entry-level tariffs for some plans in Odisha and Haryana circles on a trial basis. But they do make the case for tariff increases given ongoing plans on the rolling out of pan-India 5G services, that will result in advancing capex in FY24 to a large extent. Limited ARPU growth for the second straight quarter implies that tariff hikes are needed for further increase in ARPU. Rapid roll-out of 5G will support growth in mobile and home broadband market,\" said analysts at Jeffries. They expect ARPUs to reach  \u20b9206 by FY25, and 10% tariff hikes each over Q4FY23, FY24 and FY25. For Airtel, ARPU may grow 2% over Q1 2022, from  \u20b9190 to  \u20b9194 while Vodafone Idea may see 2.5% rise to  \u20b9134 from  \u20b9131. Airtel\u2019s consolidated EBITDA is expected to grow 2.6% on-quarter and 22.7% on-year to  \u20b918000 crore, while VIL\u2019s EBITDA may be flattish at  \u20b94100 crore due to the benefit of premiumisation and non-mobile revenue growth. However, its net loss is seen at  \u20b97300 crore. Telcos last raised tariffs in November 2021 on the pre-paid plans by 20-25%. Top executives from Airtel and Vodafone have said that tariffs needed to rise as they were the lowest in the world. Sunil Mittal, the chairman of Bharti Enterprises, the parent of Bharti Airtel, said last week that tariffs should rise to  \u20b9300 a month while Vodafone Idea top executives have previously said that tariffs needed to go up in order to ensure sustainability of the capital-intensive telecoms business.","scraped_date":"2023-01-24"}

While details of the campaign couldn\u2019t be learned, Elliott, one of the biggest and most prolific activists, often seeks board representation and pushes for companies to make operational improvements and other changes.  \u201cSalesforce is one of the pre-eminent software companies in the world, and having followed the company for nearly two decades, we have developed a deep respect for [Co-Chief Executive] Marc Benioff and what he has built,\" Jesse Cohn, managing partner at Elliott, said.  \u201cWe look forward to working constructively with Salesforce to realize the value befitting a company of its stature,\" added Mr. Cohn, who has previously served on the boards of companies including Citrix, eBay Inc. and Twitter.  It has been a turbulent stretch for Salesforce. Earlier this month, the company said it was laying off 10% of its workforce and reducing its office space in certain markets.  Mr. Benioff said many customers are taking a more cautious approach to spending, something more software companies are facing amid fears of an economic slowdown. Mr. Benioff, who also serves as chairman, said Salesforce hired too many people as revenue surged earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, echoing other tech executives as industrywide layoffs intensify.MINT PREMIUMSee All\n  Salesforce had nearly 80,000 employees globally as of Oct. 31, up from more than 49,000 as of Jan. 31, 2020, according to company filings. Salesforce reported revenue for its fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 31 of $7.84 billion, up 14% from the prior year. That marked a sharp slowdown from 27% revenue growth in the same quarter a year earlier. The company also declined to issue guidance for its fiscal year 2024. Salesforce\u2019s stock, a stellar performer for years, has taken a beating, down by about half from a late-2021 high and giving the company a market capitalization of roughly $150 billion. The shares rose about 2% in early trading Monday on the news. There has been upheaval, meanwhile, in Salesforce\u2019s top ranks. Co-CEO Bret Taylor is expected to vacate his position on Jan. 31, ending the company\u2019s second experiment in recent years with dual leadership. Mr. Taylor had shared the top role with Mr. Benioff for about a year. (Mr. Benioff is to become sole leader again and continue to serve as the company\u2019s chairman.) Mr. Benioff, who co-founded the business in 1999, became frustrated about how Mr. Taylor was spending his time, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive and co-founder of Slack Technologies, the workplace-messaging app Salesforce acquired during the pandemic, announced his departure last month. PHOTOS: From Twitter to Meta: Tech Layoffs by the Numbers The company had been an active acquirer in recent years. Last year, Salesforce completed the deal for Slack, for more than $27 billion. Two years prior, it spent around $15 billion for data-analytics platform Tableau Software Inc. A year before that, the company shelled out more cash and stock in a $6 billion-plus deal for MuleSoft. This isn\u2019t the first time lately that Salesforce has drawn activist interest. In October, Starboard Value LP revealed it had taken a stake in Salesforce, arguing that the company\u2019s mix of growth and profitability is far below that of its peers. Starboard founder Jeff Smith\u2018s ambition for change at the company has appeared more modest, with the firm so far stopping short of calling for specific measures. Elliott is known for taking on tech companies and others and forcing changes that also include sales and executive shake-ups. Its targets have included PayPal Holdings Inc., AT&T Inc., Dell Technologies Inc. and Twitter. Late last year, it struck an agreement with Pinterest Inc. to add Marc Steinberg, a senior Elliott portfolio manager, to the social-media company\u2019s board. With more than $55 billion in assets under management as of June, Elliott also has a private-equity arm that sometimes bids on companies that are targets of its activist campaigns.

NEW DELHI :Around a week ahead of the union budget, a report by SBI Research has suggested that there is an urgent need to revamp the credit guarantee scheme for MSMEs. The report released on Monday suggested that government should raise the maximum loan amount for coverage under Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) to  \u20b95 crore for all activities under manufacturing, services and trade sector from the current limit of  \u20b92 crore.

The U.S. Small Business Administration (US-SBA) could be the template for evolving CGTMSE as a friend-philosopher-guide-mentor for MSMEs proliferation, credit linkage, scaling and integration into the value chain,\" it said. It also recommended that guarantee coverage for the units having women promoters should be increased to 100% to give fillip to women entrepreneurship. The SBI Research report said that in the post-Covid period, credit growth to MSMEs in the industrial sector was distinctly higher on both, year-on-year (YoY) basis as well as in comparison with credit growth to large industries.\u00a0 \u201cIncentives provided by the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), coupled with lower GNPA ratios have helped in boosting credit to MSMEs. Additionally, beginning FY22, there is evidence of MSME units getting bigger with several units crossing the threshold of  \u20b9250 crores turnover and turning mid sized corporates by the new definition of MSME units,\" it said. Observing that SME units are becoming larger with the rise in economic activity, the report said that it will increase the ability of MSME units to raise capital through debt markets.\u00a0 Further, only 410 companies currently have till date listed on the BSE SME platform but nearly 40% of them have moved up to mainstream platform, indicating capital market listing helps in gaining further scale much quickly. On the progress made by the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) launched amid the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, the report said at least 14.6 lakh MSMEs accounts were saved due to the scheme. \u201cIn absolute terms, MSME loan accounts worth  \u20b92.2 lakh crore improved since inception of ECLGS for entire banking industry. This means that around 12% of the outstanding MSME credit has been saved from slipping into NPA because of the ECLG scheme,\" it said. Of 14.6 lakh MSMEs accounts that are saved due to ECLG scheme, almost 93.8% were in micro and small category. As per analysis of SBI Research, if such units slipped into NPA, then 1.65 crore workers would have become unemployed.\u00a0 \u201cThus, the ECLG scheme has saved the livelihood for 6.6 crores,\" it said.","scraped_date":"2023-01-24"}

But hoteliers are cheering the boom in travel by blue-collar workers.  Construction crews, travel nurses, truckers and sales teams from small and medium-size businesses have packed hotels for much of the past three years.  Leisure travel has been thriving since Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased. Pent-up demand exploded over the past two years and lifted resort rates to a record-high average daily rate of $275.58 in 2022, according to hotel data-and-analytics firm STR. Business travel, however, continues to lag behind activity seen in 2019, initially because of infection concerns and more recently amid layoffs and a looming recession.  But the gap is closing. In the third quarter this past year, business travel reached 71% of prepandemic levels, according to data from American Express Global Business Travel. That is up from 35% during the same quarter in 2021.  Small and medium-size businesses are driving the recovery. Transactions by this segment reached 80% of prepandemic levels in the third quarter, according to Amex GBT. Travel by global and multinational firms, by contrast, is back to only 61% of prepandemic levels.  \u201cThere\u2019s a pretty healthy gap,\" said Evan Konwiser, chief marketing and strategy officer for Amex GBT. \u201cThat\u2019s been pretty consistent really since the early days of the recovery.\"MINT PREMIUMSee All\n  Individual business travel and small internal meetings by companies bringing remote workers together represent the fastest-growing forms of business travel coming out of the pandemic, according to Amex GBT. Hotels are upgrading their food and beverage offerings and adding or expanding on-premise workspaces as they compete to host these small meetings, Mr. Konwiser said. Travel from blue-collar crews and small businesses has especially boosted demand for hotels in smaller cities across the U.S., lodging executives said. Those kinds of guests can range from sales teams looking to get face time with regional customers to specialized construction crews getting put up near a job site that would otherwise be too far to commute to each day. Those travelers tend to favor extended-stay hotels that cater to those visiting for at least a week and other hotels that offer lower- and mid-priced rates. An influx of federal spending, including the $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed into law in 2021, and this past year\u2019s $280 billion funding allocation by Congress for U.S. semiconductor production will help boost workforce business travel for years. \u201cThis surge is real,\" said Choice Hotels International Inc.\u2019s Chief Executive Pat Pacious. \u201cMiddle class, small business, construction, logistics\u2014those industry verticals\u2014that\u2019s going to continue to expand.\" Choice Hotels\u2019 sales team that focuses on securing workforce travel contracts has seen a 52% jump in the number of accounts it is servicing since 2019, Mr. Pacious said. About two-thirds of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.\u2019s business guests drove to their hotels rather than flying in the past year, Chief Executive Chris Nassetta said. That marks a reversal from prepandemic travel patterns and is a sign that bigger companies were slower to resume travel while small and medium-size businesses are hitting the road more often. Hoteliers are looking to retain and boost bookings by these guests through a variety of measures that appeal more to blue-collar workers, executives for several major hotel chains said. Ryan Bushby, 41 years old, noticed these sorts of changes at the Best Western in Milpitas, Calif., where he has been staying most weeknights while working at a construction site in the Bay Area. The hotel bar, previously stocked with IPAs and craft beers, now serves Coors Light on tap. The kitchen has changed its hours to accommodate guests who work the night shift. \u201cFrom the way this hotel really puts everything together, you can tell, they honestly cater to us, skilled labor or craft-type people,\" said Mr. Bushby, from Ukiah, Calif., who stays at the hotel during the week while working for Granite Construction Inc. BWH Hotel Group, parent company of Best Western, is focused on expanding its major workforce travel accounts and retaining the bump in demand it got from traveling medical personnel during the pandemic, Chief Executive Larry Cuculic said. About 10 years ago, BWH established a sales team dedicated to strengthening relationships with companies that often need worker housing, from utility providers to railroad companies and trucking firms, Mr. Cuculic said. When there is a natural disaster or emergency, BWH\u2019s sales team gets in touch with companies that might be responding by sending workers, he said. Spending from three major accounts in the company\u2019s workforce-travel segment grew 15% the past year from 2021, he said. Choice Hotels started buying and building brands that cater to skilled workers five years ago. In 2018, the company acquired the WoodSpring Suites brand, a move that Mr. Pacious said was in response to growing demand for midscale business travel. The company also signed a 21-hotel development deal this past year to expand its Everhome Suites brand, which was launched in 2020 to cater to the midscale business traveler, he said.","scraped_date":"2023-01-24"}

In the online travel aggregator (OTA) space, even the largest player has air as its biggest business vertical. For us, we are very clear, it will commercially be a very important segment as it will not just be about taking the share away from other OTAs, but building ourselves a new segment.\" About 50% of airline transactions happen online, while it is just 20% for hotels, he said. Cleartrip will also add alternative accommodations such as guest houses and villas to its portfolio, a category adopted by its rivals MakeMyTrip, Saffron Stays and Stay Vista for a while now. With this category it intends to target millennials and the youth who may not be spending much on travel, but looking to book longer holidays, he added. The behaviour of Indian travellers has changed post-covid and as the hybrid work culture continues for many companies, the average holiday length has gone up from two-night stays to three-four nights, he said. Travellers are also exploring leisure packages beyond destinations such as Goa and Coorg, to, say, the North East or Jodhpur in Rajasthan. \u201cPeople also want a shorter booking window with many travellers choosing to book closer to the travel dates, instead of planning in advance like they did pre-pandemic. For flying, a high proportion of travellers would typically take a 30-day booking window, but now it\u2019s happening within 2-3 weeks.\" In India, ticket prices have seen a slight correction for the first time in about a year by 10% due to a reduction in crude oil and ATF prices, which was passed onto the consumers, especially for metro routes, he added. However, from pre-covid levels, airfares have increased by at least 30% on most sectors, and will continue to remain high. \u201cSince demand is still very high with over 390,000 daily passengers on around 2,800 domestic flights and airlines running at 90% capacity, they see no reason to drop their tariffs,\" Ayyappan said. The market has seen 10-15% lower bookings in December and that has prompted many companies to offer a sale in the early weeks of January. Cleartirp has pushed the paddle on marketing efforts in the last calendar year. It roped in actors Katrina Kaif and Vicky Kaushal for about a month for its TV and digital campaign, which the company is considering reviving. In FY21, the online travel company, which has offices in Mumbai and Dubai, reported declining revenue with its net loss widening to  \u20b9358.61 crore, from  \u20b918.23 crore in the previous fiscal. As per the registrar of companies filings of the company, accessed via the business intelligence platform Tofler, its revenue from operations declined marginally to  \u20b954.74 crore in the fiscal, from  \u20b958.47 crore. One of the major expense buckets for the firm was advertising and marketing costs, which also grew twenty times. India has a large travel market, which is projected to reach $125 billion by FY\u201927 from an estimated $75 billion in FY20, according to a report by industry body FICCI.","scraped_date":"2023-01-24"}

Many IT product and services firms, edtechs and fintechs are struggling after the over-hiring of pandemic years, when they snapped up talent at steep salaries assuming continued growth. Today, pressure from investors, an expected global recession and the domino impact of global layoffs have combined to result in staff cuts. Last week, Google fired 12,000 employees, joining tech giants such as Meta, Amazon and Microsoft, which have laid off 11,000, 18,000 and 11,000 workers, respectively. \u201cFifteen thousand employees will get retrenched over the next six months, but this will be the last leg of the recession. However, there are skilled employees who are getting absorbed into the industry. Attrition in many of the product or IT service firms are upwards of 15%, which means despite layoffs, there is room for lateral hirings,\" said Kamal Karanth, co-founder of Xpheno, which specializes in technology and startup hiring. IT services companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Tech face high employee costs, even though overall headcount has fallen.  The impact is mostly on junior and middle-level employees, but search firms in charge of senior hiring in tech and startup sectors said leadership hiring had slowed as well. \u201cThere are a couple of cases where the decision-making is getting delayed, but that\u2019s about it. In fact, as a side effect of this retrenchment news, clients have raised their expectations, imagining that a lot of talent is now available,\" said Amit Agarwal, managing director, Singapore and India, Stanton Chase. \u201cHowever, the matter of fact is companies are not letting go of their key talent or high performers at the top. So, the battle for leadership only intensifies,\" he added. Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder and executive director of TeamLease Services, expects employers to remain cautious for at least the first quarter of the new fiscal. \u201cIT hiring has gone down, and there is tepidness in the market,\" Chakraborty said.","scraped_date":"2023-01-24"}

This high court on Friday granted six weeks to Yes Bank to file its appeal against the order in the Supreme Court.  \u201cRBI believes the writ petition is not maintainable and the order could have a huge sectoral impact. The central bank also believes that the administrator had all the powers of the board to write off the bonds and, therefore, the court\u2019s argument is not valid,\" said one of the two officials aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.  RBI approved the Yes Bank administrator\u2019s March 2020 decision to write off the AT-I bonds as part of a restructuring plan to save bank depositors from losing their savings.

An email sent to a spokesperson for RBI went unanswered. The high court, in its order, said that the administrator appointed by the RBI exceeded his powers to write off the AT-I bonds as the decision was taken after the final reconstitution scheme was notified on 13 March 2020. It said that the scheme came into force on 13 March 2020, and the bank stood reconstructed on the same day. The court ruled that AT-I bonds could only be written down before the bank\u2019s reconstruction. It also pointed out that the government-approved reconstruction scheme for Yes Bank did not include a clause for writing down these bonds. However, the court did not consider whether the writing off of the AT-1 bonds was necessary but only looked at the decision-making process. Yes Bank argued that Section 36 AC of the RBI Act allows the administrator to exercise the board\u2019s powers until a new board takes charge. \u201cThe court order is based on two grounds\u2014the date of reconstruction and the administrator did not have the power after the scheme was notified. As far as the first ground is concerned, it is incorrect to say that the date of reconstruction could be the same as the date of notification because it does not take into account the period of implementation of the reconstruction. The second reason is contrary to the RBI Act that merely because the scheme was notified, the administrator cannot exercise any powers,\" said Rohan Dakshini, a lawyer representing Yes Bank and a partner at law firm Rashmikant and Partners. \u201cThe court\u2019s observation on the deletion of the provision of the write-down from the final scheme makes no difference to the exercise by the bank of its contractual rights,\" he added. Following the Bombay high court ruling, bondholders of Lakshmi Vilas Bank also plan to seek an urgent hearing in the Madras high court against the RBI\u2019s decision to write off tier-II bonds worth  \u20b9320 crore, as the government\u2019s approved merger scheme also does not mention write-downs for these bonds.

If they participate as institutions, that gives us more space for HNIs and regular investors, and allows us to have greater HNI and retail participation,\" he said when asked about interest evinced by institutional firms, given the meteoric rise in valuations of Adani Enterprises in the past few years. \u201cThe FPO aims to maximize retail and HNI categories as they are inter-generational investors unlike mutual funds or domestic institutional investors, who have a much shorter horizon for investments,\" said Jugeshinder Singh, chief financial officer, Adani group. \u201cThere are some large family offices that can participate as institutions also, so they don\u2019t have to participate as HNI.

If you see Adani Transmission, the value accrued over a nine-year period; we started in 2012. Adani Green, we started incubating in 2011, and the value is now emerging. So we need those kinds of investors,\" he added. To draw retail investors, Adani Enterprises will offer an added discount of  \u20b964 per partly paid-up share from the cut-off price. The price range for the FPO, running through 27- 31 January, has been fixed at  \u20b93,112-3,276. Mutual funds, he said, had monetized less than 2% of Indian household wealth, allowing the group to potentially access a vast swathe of savings. It has been engaged in domestic investor outreach for the last three years, he said. \u201cWe have been running roadshows to reach domestic investors across cities: Delhi, Kolkata and Surat for five years, and next month, we will hit Rajkot to increase their count as shareholders across our group verticals. Our aim is to have 10 million retail investors. I am told by some investors that at the roadshows, they are seeing huge interactions between corporate and domestic investors, decades after what Dhirubhai Ambani would do on outreach programmes for domestic investors.\"  On steep valuations of group companies becoming a roadblock for potential retail investors, Singh said: \u201cHigh equity valuations imply that people value our growth and this reduces our risk premium, which in turn will boost the value of our utility business.\" \u201cWe feel across infra like airports, for one, we can reduce tariffs and compete with the best like in Sydney,\" he added. After the  \u20b920,000-crore proposed FPO, retail investors\u2019 holding in Adani Enterprises will increase from around 1.4% to over 3%, while promoter shareholding will drop by 3.6 percentage points. Adani Enterprises\u2019 shares have soared 174% from their 52-week lows in less than 10 months to  \u20b94189.55 on 21 December. The stock has since corrected to  \u20b93,456 apiece on 20 January. On why brokerages avoid including Adani group companies in their coverage universe, Singh said utility businesses are not tracked widely by analysts. But, this would change with time, he added. The follow-on public offer will see the group invest  \u20b910,869 crore for capital expenditure requirements of the company\u2019s subsidiaries in the green hydrogen ecosystem projects, existing airports and for construction of a greenfield expressway, while  \u20b94,165 crore will be used to repay debt either partly or fully as well as for three subsidiaries\u2014Adani Airport Holdings Ltd, Adani Road Transport Ltd, and Mundra Solar Ltd. The rest will be used for general corporate purposes, according to the offer document.  The group is also confident that its green hydrogen business will be operational in four years. \u201cWe are confident that by 2026, hydrogen will be at an operating cost of 25-30 cents. Depending on the rate of return requirement, we will sell it for between $1.80 and 2.30 a kg, which is lower than India\u2019s LNG import cost. So, already it will compete without any government subsidy,\" said Singh. The group has invested $1.6 billion in the hydrogen ecosystem and has signed a memorandum of understanding with French energy major Total. It will be investing 25% equity in the business, he said. The Adani group is also looking at various partnerships for the airport business, he added.  \u201cWe have entered a joint venture in the duty-free area. In airports, you have specific elements that address a specific consumer base, and we are looking at other JVs in fuel services and public entertainment space, among others,\" Singh said.","scraped_date":"2023-01-24"}

Speaking on company pilot project for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) for which ONGC has tied up with Norwegian state-owned energy company Equinor, the director (exploration) said that both the companies will discuss the timeline for the project, required investment and if other players need to be involved in the project. She also said that talks are underway with Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) for the procurement of carbon dioxide from the company and the required investment amount would depend upon the cost for carbon dioxide procurement. \u201cWe want to take in carbon dioxide and pump it underground, store it in the field which has been producing for a very long time now. So, that is Gandhar in the Cambay basin. For that we have a tie up with the Equinor. They have their project Northern Lights in the North Sea.

Edited excerpts: In an interview, Shukla spoke about how firms are adopting automation, disruptive role of platforms like ChatGPT and more. Edited excerpts: We heard about Automation Anywhere\u2019s IPO plan. Has it been delayed? We are growing fast, creating a very compelling product on cloud automation, which is being used by more than 70% of our new customers. We are very excited with the business we\u2019re building and will look for an opportune moment to float our public offer. Your key markets are North America and Europe but have you seen faster growth in India after the covid-19 led digital transformation wave? India has been a great source of talent and innovation for us and it continues to be. We are strengthening our place in India with two R&D centres in Bengaluru and Baroda. We are seeing growing interest from local enterprises in adopting automation. With well-known brands in India scaling their businesses, they find a need for speed and scale. We are seeing some large private banks, oil and gas companies adopting and scaling automation, and are seeing traction in healthcare, telecom, and manufacturing in India, and a great deal of interest from governments. Has the economic crisis impacted the adoption of automation? Because of speed and scale automation is the solution to turn to in a time of recession and inflationary pressures, as we all are experiencing. I think you will have seen this in past recessions as well. You will see even faster adoption of automation across all enterprises. What are your plans in India in terms of hiring and investments? We are strengthening our teams in India:R&D and to serve enterprises. Over 50% of our global workforce sits in India and that speaks for itself. The team has led the work on some of the most cutting-edge products we have launched recently. Many firms are working on integrating ChatGPT into their services. Will it become mainstream soon? Most technologies start as entertainment initially. Technologies that have capabilities like ChatGPT will become more and more mainstream. ChatGPT is an example of where we are going and what\u2019s to come. AI can be a great tool to answer questions. I think one of the things we as humans will have to get better at is thinking about what are the right questions. There is no AI software in the world that can tell you what the right question is.","scraped_date":"2023-01-24"}

JSW Steel Ltd\u2019s net profit plunged 90% in the December quarter from a year earlier, and the earnings also trailed analysts\u2019 expectations. However, Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and group chief financial officer, said a sequential analysis would do more justice to the financial performance. \u201cThe results have to be seen in the context of Q3 versus Q2, rather than year-on-year because last fiscal year was an aberration,\" he said in an interview. \u201cLast year, steel prices were very high, and raw material price increase took some time to catch up, resulting in exceptionally robust margins posted by steel companies. However, the current year saw steel price corrections post-May, and margins also got normalized.\"  \u201cThe results have to be seen in the context of Q3 versus Q2, rather than year-on-year because last fiscal year was an aberration,\" he said in an interview. \u201cLast year, steel prices were very high, and raw material price increase took some time to catch up, resulting in exceptionally robust margins posted by steel companies. However, the current year saw steel price corrections post-May, and margins also got normalized.\"  \u201cWe have booked inventory losses in Q1 and Q2 of this fiscal year, and added to that, the rupee has depreciated from 75 to 82 to a dollar. Therefore, a quarter-on-quarter comparison will be appropriate,\" he added.  After reporting a loss of  \u20b9915 crore in the September quarter, the company posted a net profit of  \u20b9474 crore in Q3 compared to  \u20b94,516 crore a year earlier. \u201cIt is a big turnaround with a swing of almost  \u20b91,400 crore,\" Rao said.  The sequential rise was helped by the highest-ever production for JSW Steel, besides a bigger share of business in the automotive sector at 33% on the back of record domestic vehicle sales. Steel dispatches to makers of tinplate, appliances, and wind and solar energy have also increased.  Nevertheless, despite good domestic volumes, JSW Steel\u2019s inventories rose to 180,000 tonnes in Q3, primarily due to a steep drop in exports, which fell by 32% and accounted for 7% of production. Consequently, total sales volume was lower by 2% sequentially.  Rao said JSW Steel\u2019s financial turnaround on a sequential basis was made possible by a reduction in costs by  \u20b97,900 per tonne, which improved earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) per tonne from  \u20b93,460 in Q2 to  \u20b98,150 in Q3. The performance of its units also improved compared to Q2 from  \u20b910 crore to  \u20b9517 crore, resulting in consolidated Ebitda rising to  \u20b94,547 crore, he added. Rao expects steel demand to stay robust in Q4, as is normally the case in the last quarter of a financial year. The auto sector typically sees an uptick in sales in Q4, compared to Q3, and state governments also have more budgets. That apart, higher agriculture-related capex and increased activities for residential real estate would result in more demand for construction equipment as well as compressors, textile machinery, paper machinery, and wagon and locomotive manufacturing, which will boost demand for steel, he added.  Steel demand in Q3 was 30 million tonnes, which Rao expects to grow by two million tonnes in Q4, taking total demand to 118 mt for FY23, up 11%. Exports may also improve due to the rollback of duty in November and the easing of covid policy in China, resulting in the restocking of material globally.  \u201cPrices have become attractive for exports, and removal of export duty will help us compete in international markets,\" Rao said. Indian steel prices are at a 6% discount to imports, which may lead to price hikes for domestic steel.  Rao, however, said commodity prices would remain range bound in 2023. \u201cThe rate hike cycle in the global economy is likely to continue though the pace may reduce. Inflation in Europe and the US is very high, and inflation targeting remains at 2%. Debt-to-GDP ratio in many countries is also very high, and so we are not very optimistic about global demand recovery,\" said Rao.  The only area for all the triggers is from China opening up. \u201cCommentary coming is that the Chinese government is more focused on consumption-led growth than investment-led growth. Prices have improved in China and Europe, in the US, too, compared to November; however, they are still down from the highs in March-April,\" Rao added.  With raw material prices rising from the lows in November, Rao said coal and iron ore prices would not sustain. Most steel companies have announced capex and expansion plans to meet demand in the domestic market. JSW Steel, too, is increasing capacity by 10mt. Out of the capex allocation of  \u20b949,000 crore,  \u20b915,000 crore will be spent in FY23, and  \u20b934,000 crore over the next two years, said Rao.  Meanwhile, JSW Steel is scouting for more iron ore mines and will participate in auctions. It is investing in iron ore beneficiation plants in Odisha and slurry pipelines to cut the cost of transportation to ports. Rao said JSW Steel\u2019s units would perform better in the March quarter. He said carrying forward of coking coal inventory from Q3 to Q4 will ensure that there won\u2019t be any impact of the current spike in coking coal prices.","scraped_date":"2023-01-24"}

Edited excerpts: MUMBAI :Authentic Brands Group, the world\u2019s second-largest brand owner and licensor globally after Walt Disney, sees India as a significant market for licensing its brands, including Reebok, Brooks Brothers, Nautica, and Forever21, to retailers. The group is scouting for more partners across retail, wholesale and manufacturers and is hoping to collaborate and take some Indian brands to global markets, too, said Henry Stupp, president of India and EMEA at Authentic Brands. In an interview, he spoke about opening an office in India and why it\u2019s an exciting market. Edited excerpts: Are you looking at opening an office in India? Are you looking at opening an office in India? Yes, very soon, probably within the year. The idea is to always identify the best-in-class partners, whether they\u2019re wholesalers, manufacturers or retailers. And once they\u2019re identified, we have to remain engaged constantly. We want to understand their business. We want to be the connective tissue, bringing a wholesaler to a retailer and introducing the retailers to our licensing partners. You just can\u2019t do that remotely. You have to be in the markets, and we\u2019re seeing a lot of success in putting in-country managers and country teams in certain markets. And dotting the i\u2019s and crossing the t\u2019s has been a very, very effective way of working. What kind of opportunity do you see here? We have about 15 partners in India, and are still in the early stages. While these are some exceptional partners, we need to do a lot more. We probably have tripled the number of partners in 12 months, but many of our brands still haven\u2019t been licensed. We\u2019re still in the process of identifying the right partners, whether they\u2019re wholesalers or retailers. And so I\u2019m spending more and more time here. This is my third trip here in the last 12 months, and I\u2019ll be back again in March. Identifying the right brands or collaboration partners is going to be critical to our India strategy. The demand for Indian fashion is increasing, and we\u2019re seeing it. I think, eventually, it\u2019s going to break through into many other global markets. So when we look at our brands like Brooks Brothers, there should be an Indian component. It should be designed in India and probably produced here. And then there\u2019s the whole opportunity of doing Indian collaborations with our brands to make them relevant for each market. That\u2019s sort of the strategy that we\u2019re planning on following. And then, to be honest with you, I think that in time, there will be brand opportunities that will come out of India that we\u2019ll want to introduce to other parts of the world. Will you be looking to take Indian brands to other markets? Absolutely. I have a very simple belief that a good product should be accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime. What is your view of manufacturers in India? I\u2019ve watched the evolution of the manufacturing base in India get better and better each and every year. I have not left without being pleasantly surprised on my last few trips about the quality of the merchandise being produced, and I\u2019m excited to see where you\u2019re going to be in the coming years. Certainly, the government is encouraging domestic manufacturing through some of the new importation rules that have been put in place that should allow the domestic industry to catch up to other markets. You have the technology, labour force, and natural resources. It\u2019s just a matter of time before I think that it will continue to grow. The interesting thing is, will the rise of domestic manufacturing and the affluence associated with it result in more Indian goods remaining in India, which is what we saw in China. For Authentic Brands, where does India stand? India is an emerging market for us, and that\u2019s why I felt that it was an incredible opportunity for me to be able to work in India and take a view of working on developing a strategy that\u2019s unique for India. There are also important lessons to be learnt from other emerging markets, including the Gulf, North Africa, and Sub-Saharan East Africa, and shared between all these different regions. I look at what Authentic Brands is doing in Turkey, which has some of the most amazing dynamic operators and is able to take good lessons learned and introduce them to other markets. It\u2019s actually one of the more exciting parts of my job. And how big is the luxury brands market in India? Data says it\u2019s about $5 billion today in retail value, and it\u2019s anticipated to grow 10 to 12% a year, which is slightly ahead of your GDP, which I think is running about 8% right now. So it is a very, very resilient category. It\u2019s highly sought after, and in the overall scheme of things, even though $5 billion is a significant market, it\u2019s still a small piece, and that\u2019s why it retains such resiliency. Who are your big partners in India? Reliance, Aditya Birla, Myntra, Flipkart, and KG Denim are a few of our partners here. I believe we have a good group of partners. What is your view on the regulatory environment regarding the retail sector in India? Every country has challenges in one way or another. I think that India is moving in a direction to address it. What is really going to drive changes in legislation is how technology is going to lead to more organised retail, where right now, it\u2019s still highly unstructured. I think the current statistics show that only 10% of Indian retail is structured. That will change, and we\u2019ve seen that happen in North Africa, East Africa, and many other markets. Technologies will lead to consolidation as it brings better value to the consumers, so that\u2019s a natural evolution in all markets. And technology will drive it towards fewer, bigger and better retailers. How big is counterfeit as a challenge? It\u2019s obviously a very big challenge, one we deal with on a daily basis. It\u2019s also true that when you\u2019re not being knocked off, you know, where\u2019s your brand heat? Having said that, I don\u2019t personally know what size it is. I don\u2019t think it is material for our portfolio, particularly in this part of the world where we\u2019re still growing, you know. We have recently come across counterfeit merchandise of Reebok, Nautica, Brooks Brother, as well as Juicy Couture, and so we are dealing with it. As the brand heat grows, we see more and more counterfeits in the market. The easiest way of addressing counterfeit merchandise is to make sure that you have a good supply chain. That is the number one way of stopping it. Have supply chains improved now after the pandemic? The pandemic led to shortfalls in the lack of availability of certain components, but that was not just for our industry. Look at the automotive industry in Europe; you can\u2019t get computer chips. They\u2019re selling cars now in Europe, where you have to come back six months later to get your navigation system installed. We faced unavailability of components, factory closures etc. Now the impact on fuel prices is something that\u2019s going to be sitting right in front of us. With China reopening, it is going to lead to increasing capacity, which is good news, but it is also going to drive up fuel demands because China being shut down really kept fuel prices, on a global basis, largely under control.","scraped_date":"2023-01-24"}

NEW DELHI :Cummins India, a maker of diesel internal combustion engines, believes that while alternative fuel technologies such as hydrogen-IC engines and fuel cells could help the trucking sector go green, they won\u2019t be adopted widely until the next decade due to significant infrastructure requirements. The company believes that diesel engines and flex-fuel options that use biofuels, blended ethanol and natural gas will remain dominant as India transitions to fully green technologies. The company believes that diesel engines and flex-fuel options that use biofuels, blended ethanol and natural gas will remain dominant as India transitions to fully green technologies. The company is investing in building electrolyzers in India to generate green hydrogen for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and fuel-agnostic platforms for Indian commercial vehicle makers as they transition to emissions-free technologies between 2040 and 2050, Ashwath Ram, managing director of Cummins India, said in an interview. \u201cNinety-nine per cent of everything we sell in India today is diesel-powered, and about 1% utilizes natural gas. Between now and 2030, we think that the CNG, LNG, biofuels and blended ethanol fuels could probably get to as high as 15%, and about 85% will continue to be with diesel, but between 2030 and 2040, we think the percentage of all those other fuels, including hydrogen, can go to 30%, and then in the 2040 to 2050 timeframe, we think we can get to 50:50. For a country like India, the time between 2050 and 2070, which is when we have committed to achieving net zero-carbon emissions, the remaining portion will also convert to green fuels\", Ram said. \u201cThe way we think about destination-zero is that it will not be a cliff event but a gradual journey towards zero. And our concern is what we can do today. In this decade, we are cleaning up the technologies. We are making our products more efficient and introducing several other platforms, such as LNG, CNG, biofuels and blended mixes with ethanol.\" According to Ram, it will take at least two decades for hydrogen-powered vehicles, particularly fuel cells, to gain wide adoption in India due to challenges such as lack of green hydrogen availability and storage, high cost of hydrogen IC-engines and fuel cell technologies, and regulatory bottlenecks. \u201cHydrogen storage and transport regulation in India says that 350 bar is the maximum pressure at which tanks can be used for hydrogen transportation. Around the world, the standard has already moved to 700 bar. When you move from 350 to 700 bar, you can store double the amount of fuel because it\u2019s pressurized,\" Ram said. \u201cSo this regulation will have to change, and it will, as the world has already changed to that standard.\" Secondly, storage tanks for hydrogen are currently not built locally. \u201cThese tanks are built from carbon fibre. We need a supply of carbon fibre, which is produced by only a few companies in the world. It\u2019s not produced in bulk volume in India as of now; so that infrastructure needs to be set up,\" Ram said. Additionally, hydrogen production for mobility will have to ramp up. \u201cToday, most of the hydrogen produced is used up in the petrochemical processes to produce ammonia and decarbonize steel. So, where is hydrogen available for use in the mobility space? The industry will have to start generating excess hydrogen just for mobility. Besides this, all hydrogen being produced today is what\u2019s called grey or blue hydrogen right out of the petrochemical process. It\u2019s not green hydrogen, which solves only part of the problem of zero-emissions, not the complete problem\", Ram said, adding that Cummins is also setting up electrolyzers in India to produce green hydrogen. Lastly, hydrogen-IC engines currently cost roughly twice that of a comparable diesel engine, while a fuel cell vehicle comes with nearly five times the cost today. \u201cThere is a huge catch-up between where fuel cells are from a cost perspective, to where hydrogen ICE can get to quickly. We see that hydrogen-IC engine is a strong bridge for India and can be a dominant technology for 25-30 years before fuel cells become viable,\" he said.","scraped_date":"2023-01-24"}

NEW DELHI :The prolonged air travel disruption caused by the pandemic has taken a heavy toll on airlines, especially two of India\u2019s oldest budget carriers, Go First and SpiceJet, which lacked the funds to weather a long crisis period. Go First and SpiceJet started flight operations in 2005, followed by the market leader, IndiGo, in 2006.

Clearly, SpiceJet and Go First have been affected and need fund infusion to maintain course,\" an industry executive said, requesting anonymity. Supply chain challenges further compounded their struggles last year, leading to delayed delivery of engines and aircraft parts. Go First, for example, only received its 55th fuel-efficient Airbus A320neo aircraft after a delay of almost one-and-a-half months. Despite having a fleet of 60 planes, including 5 Airbus 320ceos, 20-25 of its planes were grounded in the last three months due to engine and parts shortages. \u201cPratt & Whitney had provided 17 serviceable engines in December, and we could make eight aircraft serviceable. Similarly, we expect 20 serviceable engines by February-March,\" said a Go First spokesperson. \u201cWe are in the process of taking delivery of eight new aircraft from Airbus from January to June, which will take the fleet to 68.\" The spokesperson said the airline would add a new aircraft in two days. While Go First has so far availed loans of around  \u20b9590 crore under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme 3.0 (ECLGS), its proposed  \u20b93,600-crore initial public offering has been delayed. The airline is evaluating the opportunity for an IPO from time to time and will be ready to take steps, the spokesperson said. SpiceJet has also been experiencing a host of issues, including delays in the induction of MAX aircraft and fundraising. The separation and stake sale in its profitable arm SpiceXpress has faced several hurdles. \u201cThey are trying to raise capital by hiving off cargo and possibly raising funds from strategic and financial investors. Without funding, frankly, there is no game, and they realise it,\" Kapil Kaul, chief executive and director of Centre for Aviation, said. Out of its fleet of 68 aircraft, 25 have not been in operation for seven days, leaving an operational fleet of 43 planes. Lack of funds is also impacting the airline\u2019s ability to expand operations. In January-November, SpiceJet flight departures stood at 82,512, down 47% from the same period in 2019, while for Go First, flight departures fell 22.5% to 66,740 flights. IndiGo departures in the same period were at 452,798 flights, up 6% from 2019. For Vistara, flight departures in the period were 48% more than in 2019, or pre-covid levels at 72,615 departures. 2023 will be a year of intense competition between IndiGo and the Tata-run Air India group airlines. However, the situation will be even more crucial for SpiceJet and Go First to accelerate their fund infusion process, an aviation industry analyst said, requesting anonymity.","scraped_date":"2023-01-24"}

The software giant is heading into its second fiscal quarter earnings report on Tuesday facing a slumping PC market, a slowing corporate software market and even unclear demand for its once-hot cloud computing services.  Microsoft\u2019s dim forecast three months ago gave investors an early heads-up, and its plan to join other big techs in a recent layoff wave seemed to drive the point home further. \u201cWe will have to do more with less,\" Chief Executive Satya Nadella told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, before the company announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs from its payroll.  That would appear to set a low bar for the coming report. Analysts estimate that Microsoft\u2019s revenue for the December quarter grew only 2.7% year over year to $53.1 billion\u2014the company\u2019s lowest growth rate in nearly six years. Growth for the company\u2019s crucial Azure public cloud service is expected to hit a record low 30.5% year over year\u2014a deceleration of nearly 5 percentage points from the September quarter.  Revenue in the personal-computing segment that includes the Windows business is expected to slide 14% year over year\u2014a sharp reversal from the 15% growth logged in the previous year\u2019s December quarter, when the company was still benefiting from the pandemic-induced PC sales boom.MINT PREMIUMSee All\n  Microsoft\u2019s forecast for the March quarter and its outlook for the rest of the year will prove essential. Wall Street expects growth to pick back up in the second half of the calendar year. More crucially, Microsoft is expected to maintain annual operating margins above 40%\u2014the highest among the big tech peers including Apple, Amazon.com and the parent companies of Google and Facebook. Wall Street\u2019s projected operating margin of about 41% for Microsoft in calendar year 2023 is nearly 5 percentage points higher than what the company averaged over the five-year period running from 2017 to 2021 and is a much larger margin improvement than what the other four big techs are expected to show over the same period. Can the company pull that off? Maybe. Corporate tech officers are indeed cutting back their spending plans; Gartner projected that worldwide IT spending will grow 2.4% this year\u2014less than half the growth rate the market research firm predicted three months ago. Microsoft is still in a prime position given that it runs the second-largest public cloud service and owns many of the software tools and applications that are still central to business life. A recent survey by Morgan Stanley found that 38% of chief information officers rank Microsoft\u2019s Azure as their preferred cloud provider, compared with 31% for Amazon\u2019s larger AWS service. But Microsoft still has a lot of exposure to the PC market, which is in free fall. IDC reported earlier this month that PC unit sales slid 28% year over year in the fourth quarter\u2014the biggest drop that the market research firm has seen in years\u2014and doesn\u2019t expect recovery for the industry until 2024. Analyst John DiFucci of Guggenheim downgraded Microsoft to a sell rating on Jan. 17, citing both the PC slowdown and Microsoft\u2019s strong exposure to small businesses, which he says \u201ctypically fare worse than enterprises in a macro slowdown.\" Even cutting 10,000 workers might have a limited impact. That is only one-quarter of the employees Microsoft added in the fiscal year that ended in June 2022, which included the company\u2019s acquisition of Nuance Communications. In his email to employees announcing the layoffs, Mr. Nadella made clear that \u201cwe will continue to invest in strategic areas for our future,\" which includes the adoption of potentially expensive AI technology like ChatGPT across the company\u2019s products. Microsoft\u2019s highly successful transition into a cloudcentric company has deservedly earned it the faith of investors. Its ability to maintain high margins in the face of a possible recession will test that faith.

Peter and Nancy Rosalez found out in November they were eligible for up to $25,000 in government money to keep from losing their house to foreclosure.  But their mortgage company had gotten permission to foreclose on their Middletown, Ohio, home and was about to sell it. The money sat unused while an auction of the home went forward.  But their mortgage company had gotten permission to foreclose on their Middletown, Ohio, home and was about to sell it. The money sat unused while an auction of the home went forward.  \u201cThe mental anguish we\u2019ve been through with this house and trying to save this house\u2014it\u2019s just been ridiculous,\" Mrs. Rosalez said.  The federal government allocated funds for distressed homeowners as part of its expansive efforts to help Americans cope with the pandemic\u2019s financial strains. Unlike some other stimulus programs, such as checks mailed to individuals, this money moved slowly.  The nearly $10 billion Homeowner Assistance Fund was administered through the U.S. Treasury Department, but relied heavily on individual states to set up programs to distribute aid. Some were slow to get up and running. Others struggled with a backlog of applications. For homeowners, getting money before the foreclosure went through could be a race against time.  The money ultimately came through for Mr. and Mrs. Rosalez, but it came down to the wire. Expecting to be forced out of their home, the couple had packed up their belongings.  \u201cThe homeowner shouldn\u2019t be fighting on two battlefronts,\" said Jim Kowalski Jr., chief executive officer of Florida\u2019s Jacksonville Area Legal Aid Inc. That was common during the previous financial crisis, when millions lost their homes, he said. \u201cYou learned this lesson.\"MINT PREMIUMSee All\n  The fund doled out about $2 billion to more than 150,000 households through the end of September, according to the National Council of State Housing Agencies, a trade group. The money serves a narrow slice of the population: There were some 324,000 foreclosure filings last year, below prepandemic norms but more than double 2021, according to real-estate data firm Attom. The funds were made available to homeowners who experienced pandemic-related hardships and whose household incomes were below a certain threshold. Most states gave the money as grants. About 200 homeowners have complained about the program through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s complaint portal, including a handful about foreclosures moving forward while they were waiting on assistance. CFPB warned in March that foreclosing on a borrower who has a pending assistance application \u201cwill merit increased scrutiny.\" Government officials, as well as representatives of mortgage companies and states, said the assistance program has picked up speed, particularly in recent months, and everyone is working together. Servicers benefit more from taking the money than taking the home in a foreclosure, they said. The program \u201chas already provided much-needed assistance in all fifty states to over a hundred thousand low-income families,\" said Gene Sperling, who coordinates the rollout of the Biden administration\u2019s 2021 relief package, in a statement. Servicers must pause foreclosure proceedings for 60 days when a homeowner with a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loan applies for funds. But they don\u2019t have to do so for Department of Veterans Affairs loans and other government-backed mortgages. A group of federal agencies urged servicers to halt foreclosures for pending applications in such cases but stopped short of requiring it. Mr. and Mrs. Rosalez had paused payments on their VA mortgage in 2021 under a Covid forbearance program. Conversations about a loan modification with their mortgage servicer, a unit of MidFirst Bank, didn\u2019t result in a deal, according to Stephanie Moes, their legal aid attorney. The bank filed to foreclose in early August, and a court granted the request the next month. The couple filed an application in early October to Save the Dream, the Ohio program run by the state\u2019s housing-finance agency to distribute homeowner aid. They learned they were eligible for the program in November, just before a scheduled sheriff\u2019s sale of the house. Mrs. Rosalez emailed their eligibility letter to the bank. The sale went ahead and the bank was the winning bidder, which would allow it to evict the homeowners. In late December, Mrs. Rosalez called the bank\u2019s law firm. \u201cIf you have a heart, please reinstate us and let us get all this right,\" she said in a message. After The Wall Street Journal contacted MidFirst in early January, the bank asked the court to rescind the foreclosure, which was approved. A spokeswoman for the Ohio Housing Finance Agency said funds are being applied to reinstate their mortgage and cover up to six months of future payments. \u201cOnce we learn someone has been approved for HAF, our policy is to take action immediately, including as appropriate initiating the process to rescind foreclosure,\" a spokeswoman for MidFirst said. Defenders of the program say states like New York and Texas are running smoothly. That isn\u2019t the case everywhere, though. William Steinwedel, an attorney at Maryland Legal Aid Bureau, said one of his clients lost his home during a monthslong wait for assistance. In New Mexico, some homeowners are waiting months just to receive confirmation that their applications have been received, according to Eric Sutton, an attorney at the Albuquerque nonprofit United South Broadway Corp. \u201cThere are some states that are taking an alarming amount of time,\" said Stacey Tutt, an attorney who coordinates homeowner assistance at the National Housing Law Project. Homeowners who get approved after a lengthy delay might find their unpaid debt has gone up meanwhile, forcing them to use more assistance money to get their loans back on track, Ms. Tutt said. Because the fund has a fixed amount of money, that means less for other applicants. Some haven\u2019t been able to use the money at all. Christopher Elia started the process for homeowner assistance on his Orange Park, Fla., home in April, soon after his mortgage company filed for foreclosure. \u201cI stressed every day,\" Mr. Elia said. \u201cI was afraid to answer the door.\" In October, he was approved for up to $50,000 in assistance. But because of missed payments and the servicer\u2019s attorney fees, he owed more than $54,000 to reinstate the loan. Mr. Elia said he wasn\u2019t able to come up with the additional money. The $50,000 went unused. Marissa Vetter, Mr. Elia\u2019s housing counselor at Jacksonville Area Legal Aid, said she believes he could have used the assistance money if the unpaid debt hadn\u2019t ticked higher while Mr. Elia waited. A spokeswoman for Florida\u2019s Department of Economic Opportunity, which administers the state program, said Mr. Elia took three months to finish his application, delaying the process. Mr. Elia said he submitted his initial application promptly, but additional requests from the state delayed its completion. Weeks would pass in between requests, but he provided information as soon as he could, he said. The spokeswoman for the Florida agency defended its handling of aid applications, saying the state \u201cstretched every available dollar to serve as many homeowners as possible.\" To reinstate his loan, Mr. Elia agreed with the servicer to extend the repayment term from 14 years to 40 with a higher monthly payment. He is hoping to get money from the program to cover some payments on the modified loan. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cooper Group Inc., the parent company of Mr. Elia\u2019s mortgage servicer, RightPath, said the company continues to work with him. Mr. Kowalski, of Jacksonville Area Legal Aid, wrote a letter to federal regulators in November hoping to draw attention to Mr. Elia\u2019s case. \u201cYou must do better,\" he wrote.

Algorithms helped them predict periods of high and low demand and make sure stores had \u201cjust enough\" staff at those times \u2014 in theory, freeing them from having to employ quite as many workers. Yet focusing so much on optimizing worker numbers left stores painfully understaffed during the busiest periods. A 2014 study in the journal Production and Operations Management looked at 41 stores of an (anonymized) large retail chain. The researchers, led by Vidya Mani of University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business, found all 41 locations were chronically shorthanded during peak hours. Adding staff during those times would have resulted in an increase in sales and profitability, the researchers concluded.

In health care, where staffing levels have been a problem for decades, understaffing can be life-threatening. Studies have linked low staff levels in hospitals to worse outcomes for patients \u2014 specifically, in a hospital without enough workers, patients are more likely to contract an infection (because of things like decreased handwashing by frazzled staff). They also are less likely to get the right dose of medication and generally more likely to die.

The Manhattan U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office is conducting an investigation into Amazon under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, a law that allows civil cases to be brought over wrongdoing that impacts banks. The office has deployed the 1989 law at the same time the Labor Department presses a workplace safety investigation of Amazon that has already led to several citations.  The Labor Department in December cited Amazon at six of its warehouses for not adequately reporting injuries and this week cited three company facilities, saying workers were exposed to ergonomic or equipment hazards.  Amazon has said it intends to appeal the citations. The company also said it never intentionally misrepresented its safety record.  Because Firrea cases proceed under civil law the government can more easily prove claims than in a criminal prosecution, which requires juries to be convinced of charges beyond a reasonable doubt.MINT PREMIUMSee All\n  The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan issued a subpoena in August to Amazon for information the company might have shared with financial institutions involved in at least $90 million in contracts or agreements with the online retailer in the previous five years, specifically information it shared on its injury rates and labor law compliance. An Amazon unit last month challenged the subpoena and related subpoenas in federal court in Seattle. \u201cIt is difficult to understand how a safety inquiry could plausibly be shoehorned into a Firrea investigation,\" Zainab Ahmad, a partner at outside counsel Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, wrote in a letter to government lawyers that is included with court papers. \u201cFirrea addresses financial fraud, not employee safety,\" Ms. Ahmad added, calling the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s legal theory \u201cextremely tenuous\" and \u201cunprecedented.\" The office is seeking a range of documents on Amazon\u2019s labor practices, including internal communications touching on policies around workplace productivity. The office also wants video surveillance footage of Amazon facilities and has served subpoenas to take testimony from Amazon employees, including high-level executives, according to Ms. Ahmad. Amazon in court papers in the case in Seattle said the information demands are \u201cunrealistic\" and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office stretched to assert jurisdiction under Firrea. While the law was meant to target insiders who looted savings-and-loan institutions, it has been applied in novel ways by government lawyers, said Robert Giuffra, a partner at the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP who has worked on Firrea-related litigation. \u201cThe Justice Department has a history of misusing the Firrea statute and stretching it far beyond its intended purposes,\" he added. Firrea emerged as a \u201csuperweapon\" for the U.S. Justice Department following the 2008 financial crisis, when it was used to bring cases against banks themselves, said Brian Feldman, a lawyer formerly with the civil fraud unit of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan who now is in private practice at Harter Secrest & Emery LLP. Mr. Feldman, who worked on Firrea-related cases during his time in the office, said that while the Amazon case involves a \u201cnovel set of circumstances,\" Firrea is written to allow the government to tackle a variety of fraud affecting banks. Any fraud case against Amazon would turn on whether the company had made misrepresentations to lenders and whether those misrepresentations impacted their decision-making, he said.

The Justice Department is investigating conduct at the Abbott Laboratories infant-formula plant in Sturgis, Mich., that led to its shutdown last year and worsened a nationwide formula shortage, people familiar with the matter said.  Attorneys with the Justice Department\u2019s consumer-protection branch are conducting the criminal investigation, the people said.  Attorneys with the Justice Department\u2019s consumer-protection branch are conducting the criminal investigation, the people said.  The branch, which has criminal as well as civil authority, was involved last year in a settlement with Abbott that allowed its Sturgis plant to resume operations after Food and Drug Administration inspectors found a potentially deadly bacteria there.  \u201cThe DOJ has informed us of its investigation, and we\u2019re cooperating fully,\" an Abbott spokesman said.  The investigation signals further scrutiny of Abbott\u2019s operation of the plant, a major source of baby formula in the U.S., and perhaps of the more than $4 billion formula industry.  The Justice Department in the past decade has investigated numerous food companies that have shipped contaminated products that resulted in illnesses or deaths.  Several have led to criminal prosecutions under the 1938 Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of companies or executives involved in producing goods from ice cream to peanut butter. The law allows government officials to prosecute entities or individuals who introduce adulterated food into interstate commerce.  In many recent cases, DOJ has been able to successfully prosecute defendants on misdemeanor charges for introducing contaminated food into the market even without proof that officials acted with criminal intent, according to Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who represents victims of food-borne illnesses.MINT PREMIUMSee All\n  Abbott, based outside Chicago, is one of the biggest manufacturers of baby formula. The company sells Similac, among other brands. Last January, FDA inspectors found bacteria at the plant after receiving reports of babies who drank the company\u2019s formula and became sick. The inspectors also found standing water, damage to drying equipment and defects in the seams of formula cans, among other problems at the Sturgis plant. Federal officials couldn\u2019t conclusively link the bacteria at the plant to the infants\u2019 illnesses, however. Abbott has said genetic sequencing of the bacteria in the sick babies didn\u2019t match the strains found at the plant. Abbott temporarily halted production at the Sturgis factory in February, and recalled baby formula made at the plant. The moves contributed to an infant formula shortage that sent parents and federal officials scrambling for months. To bolster supplies, the federal government waived regulatory requirements and tariffs to allow more foreign formula into the country, and the White House organized planes to fly baby formula to the U.S. Abbott last May signed a legal agreement, called a consent decree, detailing the steps it would need to take to reopen the plant. In the complaint accompanying that civil agreement, the Justice Department said Abbott and several of its employees had caused \u201cadulterated food\" to enter interstate commerce. \u201cOngoing inadequacies in manufacturing conditions and practices at Defendants\u2019 facilities demonstrate that Defendants have been unwilling or unable to implement sustainable corrective actions to ensure the safety and quality of food manufactured for infants, a consumer group particularly vulnerable to foodborne pathogens,\" the department said in the complaint. Also in May, Abbott Chief Executive Robert Ford apologized for the company\u2019s role in the formula shortage, and said it was making investments to avoid a repeat. The company reopened the plant in June. Limited formula supplies continued into September, however, when adults in roughly one-third of households with infant children on formula had trouble getting it, according U.S. Census Bureau data. By October, in-stock rates had stabilized close to where they had been before the Sturgis plant shut down, federal officials have said. In 2020, the Justice Department filed criminal charges against Texas ice-cream company Blue Bell Creameries LP and its former chief executive following an investigation into a listeria outbreak tied to three deaths and other illnesses. Blue Bell agreed to pay $19 million and plead guilty to two misdemeanor charges related to shipments of contaminated ice cream. The former chief executive has pleaded not guilty to the charges. That same year, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. said it would pay a record $25 million to resolve criminal charges stemming from a series of foodborne-illness outbreaks involving its restaurants that sickened more than 1,000 people. In 2015, Stewart Parnell, the former owner of Peanut Corp. of America, was sentenced to 28 years in prison a year after being convicted of presiding over a coverup that led to a deadly salmonella outbreak. \u00a0","scraped_date":"2023-01-24"}

Tom Forte, senior research analyst at investment bank D.A.

The company could move in the direction of making other cuts or adjustments to perks that are common in Silicon Valley.

US technology stocks are about to hit their next hurdle when earnings season for the most influential segment of the S&P 500 Index gets underway in the coming week: vanishing profits.

Google parent Alphabet Inc. followed with plans of its own to shrink its workforce. Wall Street has been slashing earnings estimates for months for the tech sector, which is projected to be the biggest drag on S&P 500 profits in the fourth quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. The danger for investors, however, is that analysts still prove too optimistic, with demand for the industry\u2019s products crumbling as the economy cools. \u201cTech is driving a lot of the overall earnings recession that we\u2019re seeing in the S&P,\" said Michael Casper, an equity strategist with Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cWhile there\u2019s a lot baked in, depending on if this recession does emerge and how badly it occurs, there is certainly some negative revision risk for the sector still.\" Firms including Texas Instruments Inc., Lam Research Corp. and Intel Corp. also report next week. Apple Inc., Alphabet and other behemoths announce the week after. The group has huge sway over the path of the overall market, with info-tech accounting for more than 25% of the S&P 500\u2019s market capitalization. Fourth-quarter earnings for tech firms in the benchmark are projected to drop 9.2% from the same period a year earlier, the steepest slide since 2016, data compiled by BI show. The speed of the deterioration in sentiment is notable: Three months ago, Wall Street merely saw profits coming in flat. Revenue growth for these companies is fading relative to the past couple of years, when the pandemic and ensuing lockdowns supercharged sales for everything from digital services to personal computers and the components that power them. Higher costs are also squeezing profits. Valuation Concerns The concern, however, is that valuations are still far from cheap despite last year\u2019s 33% tumble in the Nasdaq 100. The gauge is priced at about 21 times profits projected over the next 12 months, compared with an average of 20.5 for the past decade, and further estimate cuts would only make it look more expensive. The multiple bottomed at 17.7 in 2020 and at 11.3 in 2011, in the wake of the recession that ended in 2009. Still, for Sameer Bhasin, principal at Value Point Capital, most of the bad news has been priced in. He anticipates that first-quarter profit estimates may have further to fall, but says some of the fears are overblown. \u201cTech isn\u2019t suffering from an industry demand issue, it\u2019s suffering more from a digestion of the excesses that were built in during the pandemic,\" he said. \u201cThere\u2019s money on the sidelines that is waiting to be put back into the sector.\" Analysts anticipate that tech profits will return to growth in the second half of the year, data compiled by BI show. That will make executives\u2019 outlooks for the full year all the more critical for stocks. As earnings roll in over the next few weeks, investors will have plenty of risks to monitor. Among them are the possibility that inflation proves to be more entrenched than many expect, as well as the effect of higher rates on profits, says Nick Getaz, a portfolio manager of the Franklin Rising Dividends Fund. \u201cMonetary policy has a lag and we\u2019re likely still in the window of that,\" he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the earnings impact you\u2019d expect to see from rate hikes.\" \u00a0 This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.","scraped_date":"2023-01-24"}
