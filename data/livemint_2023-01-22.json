During Q3 FY23, the exchange logged electricity volumes of 23 BU, a growth of 9% QoQ, but down 2% YoY.  Trade volumes were impacted largely due to supply-side constraints, led by high prices of e-auction coal. REC (renewable energy certificates) volumes at 1.2 BU during the third quarter of FY2022-23 witnessed a de-growth of 68 per cent on a YoY basis as the year-ago period had exceptionally high REC volumes to fulfil the pent-up demand caused by stay on REC trading by APTEL for a period of 16 months, it stated. Overall volumes at the exchange was 24.2 BU during Q3 FY23, a 5% rise sequentially across market segments. However, volumes declined 12% YoY, because of power supply side constraints, high prices discovered during Q3 FY 2023 and high REC traded volumes during the quarter under review. In the quarter, price of e-auction coal continued to be high. While the quarterly average price premium declined from 293% in the second quarter of FY23 to 242% in the third, it was considerably higher compared to 35% for special forward e-auction price for the power sector in FY22. As a result, input cost for gencos continued to be high. Persistent high spot e-auction coal prices led to average clearing price in the day-ahead market at  \u20b94.56 in Q3 FY2023, while lower from  \u20b95.40 in the previous quarter, but still high to provide optimization potential for discoms and open access consumers, it said. Improving coal inventory and reduction in e-auction prices are expected to result in a decline in power prices on the exchange and provide further cost optimisation opportunities to discoms and open access consumers. This is expected to result in higher volumes on the exchange. IGX traded a total gas volumes of 24.42 million MMBtu during Q3 FY23, which was a 568% YoY increase. The growth was, largely, the result of the participation from major domestic gas producers and an increase in the number of participants. ","scraped_date":"2023-01-22"}

Elon Musk took the witness stand Friday to defend a 2018 tweet claiming he had lined up the financing to take Tesla private in a deal that never came close to happening. The tweet resulted in a $40 million settlement with securities regulators. It also led to a class-action lawsuit alleging he misled investors, pulling him into court for about a half hour Friday to deliver sworn testimony in front of a nine-person jury and a full room of media and other spectators. The tweet resulted in a $40 million settlement with securities regulators. It also led to a class-action lawsuit alleging he misled investors, pulling him into court for about a half hour Friday to deliver sworn testimony in front of a nine-person jury and a full room of media and other spectators. The trial was then adjourned for the weekend and Musk was told to return Monday to answer more questions. In his initial appearance on the stand, Musk defended his prolific tweeting as \u201cthe most democratic way\" to distribute information even while acknowledging constraints of Twitter's 280-character limit can make it difficult to make everything as clear as possible. \u201cI think you can absolutely be truthful (on Twitter),\" Musk asserted on the stand. \u201cBut can you be comprehensive? Of course not,\" Musk's latest headache stems from the inherent brevity on Twitter, a service that he has been running since completing his $44 billion purchase of it in October. The trial hinges on the question of whether a pair of tweets that Musk posted on Aug. 7, 2018, damaged Tesla shareholders during a 10-day period leading up to a Musk admission that the buyout he had envisioned wasn\u2019t going to happen. In the first of those those two 2018 tweets, Musk stated \u201cfunding secured\" for a what would have been a $72 billion buyout of Tesla at a time when the electric automaker was still grapping with production problems and was worth far less than it is now. Musk followed up a few hours later with another tweet suggesting a deal was imminent. After it became apparent that the money wasn't in place to take Tesla private, Musk stepped down as Tesla\u2019s chairman while remaining CEO as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission settlement, without acknowledging any wrongdoing. The impulsive billionaire came into court wearing a dark suit and tie on the third day of the civil trial in San Francisco that his lawyer unsuccessfully tried to move to Texas, where Tesla is now headquartered, on the premise that media coverage of his tumultuous takeover of Twitter had tainted the jury pool. The jury that was assembled earlier this week focused intently on Musk while he answered questions posed by Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer representing Tesla shareholders. At one point, Musk asked Porritt if he would speak closer to the microphone so he could hear him better. At other times, Musk craned his neck as he gazed around the courtroom. Musk, 51, said he cares \u201ca great deal\" about investors and also railed against short sellers who make investments that reward them when a company's stock price falls. He called short selling an \u201cevil\" practice that should be outlawed, denigrating those who profit from it as \u201ca bunch of sharks.\" When shown communications from Tesla investors urging him to curtail or completely stop his Twitter habit before the 2018 buyout tweet, Musk said he couldn't remember all those interactions from years ago, especially since he gets a \u201cNiagara Falls\" of emails. Even before Musk took the stand, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen had declared that the jurors can consider those two tweets to be false, leaving them to decide whether Musk deliberately deceived investors and whether his statements saddled them with losses. Musk has previously contended he entered into the SEC settlement under duress and maintained he believed he had locked up financial backing for a Tesla buyout during meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund. An expert on corporate buyouts hired by shareholder lawyers to study the events surrounding Musk's proposal to take Tesla private spent the bulk of his three hours on the stand Friday deriding the plan as an ill-conceived concept. \u201cThis proposal was an extreme outlier,\" said Guhan Subramanian, a Harvard University business and law professor for more than 20 years. \u201cIt was incoherent. It was illusory.\" In a lengthy cross examination that delayed Musk's appearance, a lawyer for Tesla's board of directors tried to undermine Subramanian's testimony by pointing out that it relied on graduate student assistance to review some of the material related to the August 2018 tweets. The lawyer, William Price, also noted Subramanian's $1,900-per-hour fee for compiling his report for the case. The trial over his Tesla tweets come at a time when Musk has been focusing on Twitter while also serving as the automaker's CEO and also remaining deeply involved in SpaceX, the rocket ship company he founded. Musk\u2019s leadership of Twitter \u2014 where he has gutted the staff and alienated users and advertisers \u2014 has proven unpopular among Tesla\u2019s current stockholders, who are worried he has been devoting less time steering the automaker at a time of intensifying competition. Those concerns contributed to a 65% decline in Tesla\u2019s stock last year that wiped out more than $700 billion in shareholder wealth \u2014 far more than the $14 billion swing in fortune that occurred between the company\u2019s high and low stock prices during the Aug. 7-17, 2018 period covered in the class-action lawsuit. Tesla\u2019s stock has split twice since then, making the $420 buyout price cited in his 2018 tweet worth $28 on adjusted basis now. The company's shares were trading around $133.42 Friday, down from the company\u2019s November 2021 split-adjusted peak of $414.50. After Musk dropped the idea of a Tesla buyout, the company overcame its production problems, resulting in a rapid upturn in car sales that caused its stock to soar and minted Musk as the world\u2019s richest person until he bought Twitter. Musk dropped from the top spot on the wealth list after the stock market\u2019s backlash to his handling of Twitter. When asked Friday about the challenges that Tesla faced in 2018, he recalled spending many nights sleeping at the automaker's California factory as he tried to keep the company afloat. \u201cThe sheer level of pain to make Tesla successful during that 2017, 2018 period was excruciating,\" he recalled.","scraped_date":"2023-01-22"}

In March 2020, RBI superseded Yes Bank\u2019s board and appointed Prashant Kumar as administrator, citing the bank\u2019s adverse financial position, mainly due to its inability to raise fresh capital. It was then put through a restructuring scheme involving the bond write-off. The Yes Bank AT1 Bond Holders Association approached the high court for claims worth  \u20b9160 crore, challenging the legality and validity of the write-off. In its writ petition, the association said, \u201cOur members are individual retail investors, most of whom are above 60 years of age, who have been wrongfully lured into investing in AT-1 bonds issued by Yes Bank, which were meant for allotment only to institutional investors and corporate bodies for which they were ineligible.\" The association said the bank\u2019s relationship managers had mis-sold the bonds to retail investors as \u2018super fixed deposits\u2019.

This wasn\u2019t to happen. NEW DELHI :When India\u2019s second largest airline Jet Airways suspended operations in April 2019, vacating over 15% market share, SpiceJet was seen as a clear contender to take its place. This wasn\u2019t to happen. At first, the airline did secure the number two spot, after IndiGo, for two consecutive years with a 14.9% market share in 2019 and 2020, up from 12.3% in 2018. However, ever since it has been on a downhill road.  At first, the airline did secure the number two spot, after IndiGo, for two consecutive years with a 14.9% market share in 2019 and 2020, up from 12.3% in 2018. However, ever since it has been on a downhill road.  The domestic market share of the low-cost airline fell to 10.5% in 2021, pushing it to the third place with state-run consolidated Air India and Alliance Air pack pipping it to the second spot. According to the latest data, SpiceJet now holds the fourth position in India along with Tata Group-run Air India. IndiGo has been India\u2019s largest airline for over a decade, with a 56.1% share, followed by Vistara (9.2%), and GoFIRST at 8.8%.  SpiceJet had faced two fundamental issues prior to the covid-19 pandemic\u2014 one, it could do little about, and the other was in its control, chief executive officer and director, Centre for Aviation CAPA India, Kapil Kaul told Mint. \u201cWhat was not in their hands was the 737 MAX issue. If you look at their fleet delivery programme, they would have generated more sale and leaseback if the 737 MAX aircraft had been inducted in time... it took a significant toll on SpiceJet. Had the 737 MAX been orderly the result would have been different but it was out of their hands,\" Kaul said. After the Boeing MAX aircraft was grounded by aviation regulators across the globe in March 2019 following two fatal crashes, SpiceJet had to also delist 13 MAX aircraft in its fleet. The ban was revoked in 2021 and in India, the regulator approved the entry into service of the grounded fleet of the fuel-efficient aircraft in August that year.  While the total order book of SpiceJet for MAX extended to 205 airplanes with firm orders of 155 aircraft, the fleet size of the airline shrank to 88 in FY22 from 114 in 2019-20. According to flight tracking website flightradar24, the airline currently has 68 aircraft in its fleet, out of which more than 25 have not been in operation for at least seven days, leaving an operational fleet of around 43 planes.  \u201cWhat was in their hands was raising capital on time\u2014they had opportunities before covid to raise capital. Unfortunately, they did not know covid was coming and they kept delaying it (fund raising),\" Kaul added. The airline has attempted to raise funds several times in the last two years but the discussions have not been fruitful so far. SpiceJet said last year that it was engaged with investment bankers to raise up to $200 million to achieve its future plans. There were also plans to get strategic investors on board via a stake sale but none of the initiatives have taken off yet. \u201cThe airline\u2019s promoter has been trying to raise funds via multiple platforms as it is a crucial stage for SpiceJet and now the management also knows that. The cargo business, which was supposed to be hived off in 2022 itself, has also been delayed. There is no clarity on the airline\u2019s plan of raising $200 million. So far, ECLGS (Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme) has been its only saviour,\" an industry executive said. The airline has received  \u20b9358 crore so far under ECLGS and will raise more funds via ECLGS as and when required, a SpiceJet spokesperson said. On 17 August, 2021, SpiceJet had announced it was transferring its cargo and logistics services on a slump sale basis to its subsidiary SpiceXpress as it would allow the company to raise funds independently of the budget carrier and grow rapidly. Banks and shareholders gave their approval to hive off SpiceXpress in July 2022 and the carrier\u2019s CMD Ajay Singh said the bifurcation will be done by the first week of August. The timeline for this exercise was later postponed to the Oct-Dec quarter of 2022 but it is yet to take place.Responding to Mint\u2019s queries, the SpiceJet spokesperson said the plan to raise $200 million and the process to hive off SpiceXpress is underway. \u201cThe company continues to be in discussions with various investors to secure sustainable financing and will make appropriate disclosures in accordance with applicable regulations,\" he said. \u201cSpiceJet has been inducting planes at regular intervals as per its short term and long term requirements and aircraft induction will continue as per contracts with lessors and manufacturer,\" the spokesperson said. The lack of funds is also impacting the airline\u2019s ability to expand operations. During Jan-Nov of 2022, SpiceJet flight departures stood at 82,512 flights, 47% down from the same period of pre-covid year of 2019. IndiGo flight departures during the same period were at 452,798 flights, 6% up from 2019 and for Vistara the flight departures in Jan-Nov were 48% more than in 2019 at 72,615 departures. CAPA India said that while the airline showed \u201cremarkable resilience\" to sustain operations during covid, the after-effects of covid pandemic will be deep and long-lasting. \u201cThe only way is to raise capital and they are trying to raise capital and they are trying to raise capital by hiving off cargo and possibly raising funds from strategic or financial investors. Without funding, frankly there is no game and I think they realise that,\" Kaul said. For Oct-Dec, Elara Capital expects the airline\u2019s passenger volume to improve 12% on quarter; however, it is expected to decline 5% on year due to 50% grounding of fleet based on regulatory restrictions.","scraped_date":"2023-01-22"}

Coforge said its executable order book, or the total contract value of deals for the next 12 months, is $841 million. It reported the lowest attrition levels among IT services companies, at 15.8%, falling 0.6%, sequentially. For the fourth straight quarter, Coforge signed $300-million-plus deals in Q3. Interestingly, the company is seeing a surge in high-value contracts amid a year of falling growth for India\u2019s IT services sector, declining around 26% in 2022 from a year ago, as per the 30-share BSE IT index. Coforge\u2019s Q3 results were published before the opening of trading on Friday. The company\u2019s shares ended the day up 3.38% from the previous close at  \u20b94,100.55 apiece. The BSE IT index closed 0.48% down on Friday, at  \u20b929,463.99. InQ3, Coforge announced a \u2018digital and metaverse centre of excellence showcase, a virtual reality services platform. Its India revenue, accounting for 3.5% of revenue, fell 8.5% to  \u20b972.9 crore, but this was offset by revenue growth in North America and Europe. Coforge\u2019s financial results are in line with the rest of the domestic IT services industry, which has seen four out of the top six companies post strong numbers. Barring Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCLTech and Wipro all outperformed analyst estimates. As a result of its financial performance during the seasonally weak quarter, Coforge chief executive, Sudhir Singh, upgraded the company\u2019s FY23 annual revenue growth guidance to 22%. The company also announced a dividend of  \u20b919 per share. Analysts said that Coforge\u2019s overall performance is based on the company\u2019s focus on specific high-growth sectors such as travel \u2014 in contrast to how large-cap IT companies are facing market challenges due to slowdown in tech spending in traditionally large sectors, such as banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI). Ruchi Burde Mukhija, vice-president of equities research and financial services firm Elara Capital, said that demand among offshore (non-Indian) clients for digital transformation and automation remains strong. \u201cCoforge highlighted that they work with 50 of the world\u2019s top 100 companies, so it\u2019s not just that smaller companies are working on small ticket-size digital transformation projects. Even Infosys has seen good deal signings, and this is due to the clients of domestic IT services firms focusing on cost optimisation,\" she said. Mukhija added that the market demand, despite inflationary concerns in the West, is \u201cnot as bad as what initial headlines had projected.\" \u201cThe demand buoyancy remains strong, and companies that are doing well in specific verticals that are seeing strong demand are set to do well in the upcoming quarters as well,\" she added. Coforge\u2019s December quarter performance bucks the trend of large-cap IT services firms signing smaller value deals of shorter tenures and TCVs, as against the previous trend of large deals making the headlines. However, most firms reported a resilient December quarter \u2014 for instance, Infosys disclosed a TCV of $3.3 billion in new deals, while Wipro disclosed an annual growth of over 30% in the revenue it earned from offering \u2018product platforms\u2019 to its clients. Product platforms refer to software-based platforms, such as those made by SAP, Microsoft or IBM \u2014 which an IT services firm leases from a software maker, and subsequently provides to clients. A January 13 report on the Indian IT services sector by equities research firm, BNP Paribas, said that the trend of deal signings by Indian IT firms showcase resilience and robustness across the world in terms of the demand for tech products and services. Kumar Rakesh, vice-president of equities research at BNP Paribas, said in the report that digital services, automation and cloud products were among the most in-demand services among the multiple long-tenured deals signed through the quarter.","scraped_date":"2023-01-22"}

NEW DELHI : Food and grocery delivery aggregator Swiggy has laid off 380 employees or nearly 6% of its 6,000-strong staff, becoming the latest to join the flurry of layoffs in India\u2019s startup ecosystem.  Tech firms across the board have ramped up their cost-cutting measures with layoffs being the primary one. Already this year, by its third week, over 1,500 employees have been fired by Indian startups, while the number was higher for US-based tech giants including Microsoft which laid off about 10,000 employees earlier this week.  Tech firms across the board have ramped up their cost-cutting measures with layoffs being the primary one. Already this year, by its third week, over 1,500 employees have been fired by Indian startups, while the number was higher for US-based tech giants including Microsoft which laid off about 10,000 employees earlier this week.  The delivery platform\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, Sriharsha Majety cited macroeconomic headwinds and a shrinking growth of food delivery businesses as the reason behind the layoffs.  \u201cWe\u2019re implementing a very difficult decision to reduce the size of our team as a part of a restructuring exercise. In this process, we will be bidding goodbye to 380 staff,\u201c Majety said in an internal e-mail to employees.  \u201cWhile our cash reserves allow us to be fundamentally well positioned to weather harsh circumstances, we cannot make this a crutch and must continue identifying efficiencies to secure our long-term,\" he said, adding, \u201cour over-hiring is a case of poor judgment, and the company\u2019s management should\u2019ve done better.\" All of its 6,000 employees are full-time ones, listed on Swiggy\u2019s payrolls. The laid off employees do not include any contractual workers such as its delivery partners.  Swiggy is also looking to shut down some verticals as a cost-reduction measure, Majety said: \u201cEffective very soon, we will be shutting down our meat marketplace.\"  \u201cWhile the team has done exceptionally well with solid inputs, we haven\u2019t hit product market fit here despite our iterations. From a customer perspective, we will continue to offer meat delivery through Instamart,\" he said.  Even as the platform did not specify which division will be impacted, its marketing, human resources, technology and operations teams are most likely to be affected, including some senior-level employees as well, said a person privy to the matter. Last month, Swiggy also shut down the operations of one of its cloud kitchens, The Bowl Company, in Delhi NCR, shortly after launching it as an experimental project in the area.  The food delivery platform will offer the laid off employees a minimum payout of 3 months or a notice period which can be extended by 15 days or more, based on their tenure in the company. The impacted employees will be eligible for the employee-stock-options (ESOPs)liquidity program scheduled for July this year, the e-mail said.  The Bengaluru-based food delivery platform\u2019s rising costs also dented its earnings in financial year (FY) 2022 after Bundl Technologies Pvt Ltd, which operates the foodtech platform, reported a consolidated loss of  \u20b93,628.9 crore, more than double of its  \u20b91,616.9 crore loss in the preceding financial year.  The loss came on the back of Swiggy\u2019s expenses which ballooned about 2.3x to about  \u20b99,600 crore, compared to  \u20b94,139.4 crore in FY21. Its revenue from operations, however, also doubled during the year to  \u20b95704.9 crore from  \u20b92546.9 crore in the year before.  SoftBank-backed Swiggy, last valued at $10.7 billion, provides a marketplace for food orders and delivery through its technology platform.  The company had last raised $700 million in a funding round led by Invesco in January 2022. It is backed by investors including Alpha Wave Global, Qatar Investment Authority, and ARK Impact, among others.  In other developments around layoffs, a bunch of Indian startups have sacked staff in the recent past, citing macroeconomic headwinds, a looming recession in the US leading to a tech rout and economic hurdles due to geopolitical tensions in Europe.  Lightspeed-backed Hubilo Technologies Inc, Exotel, ShareChat parent Mohalla Tech Pvt Ltd, quick commerce platform Dunzo, Lead School, UpGrad-owned Harappa Education, cloud kitchen startup Rebel Foods, mobility startup Ola, e-2wheeler maker Bounce, voice automation startup Skit.ai, industrial goods marketplace Moglix, and UpScalio, a Thrasio-style venture, were the latest to lay off their employees this year.","scraped_date":"2023-01-22"}

The incident of passenger misbehaviour, wherein a male passenger conducted himself in a disorderly manner and allegedly relieved himself on a female passenger, occurred on AI-102 New York-Delhi flight on 26 November 2022, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said.  It had come to the notice of DGCA on 4 January.  The regulator has also suspended the licence of the pilot-in-command for a period of three months for failing to discharge his duties as per Rule 141 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937, and applicable DGCA Civil Aviation Requirements. A penalty of  \u20b93 lakh has been imposed on director-in-flight services at Air India for failing to discharge her duties as per applicable DGCA Civil Aviation Requirements.  On 5 January, the regulator had said that prima facie it has emerged that provisions related to handling of an unruly passenger on-board have not been complied with. \u201cThe conduct of the concerned airline appears to be unprofessional and has led to a systemic failure,\u201cit had said.  The regulator had then issued a show-cause notice to the airline\u2019s accountable manager, director in-flight services, all pilots and cabin crew of the flight as to why enforcement action should not be taken against them for dereliction of regulatory obligations.  The respondents were given two weeks\u2018 time and the DGCA imposed penalties after examination of the written reply of Air India and the personnel involved.  The accused in the incident, Shankar Mishra, has been banned from flying with Air India for four months after an internal committee determined on 19 January that he was an unruly passenger who urinated on a co-passenger. Mishra, a senior executive at US financial services firm Wells Fargo, has since been terminated by his employer. Delhi Police also arrested Mishra from Bengaluru on 7 January, and he has been sent to 14-day judicial custody.","scraped_date":"2023-01-22"}

Uncertainty about the future profitability of Disney\u2019s enormous entertainment portfolio has caused a rollercoaster ride in its share price. It threw out its chief executive in November and will soon replace its chairman. It also faces a rebellion from an activist investment firm that wants a board seat in what could turn into the biggest face-off since Michael Eisner, a previous CEO, was forced out in 2005. Disney\u2019s trials are not just a boardroom drama. Similar crises are unfolding at other leading culture factories, from Warner Bros to Netflix. The reason is a technological revolution that is turning Hollywood upside down. The continuing pre-eminence of a centenarian like Disney has confounded many predictions. Since the days of \u201cSteamboat Willie\", Mickey Mouse\u2019s first outing in 1928, there has been an explosion in the supply of video entertainment. Television, cable, home video and then the internet have offered increasing amounts of choice. Anyone with a phone can record video and make it accessible to billions of people, free of charge. More content is uploaded to YouTube every hour than Disney+ holds in its entire streaming catalogue. Many predicted that this surge of niche content would bring down mainstream hit-makers. They were mostly wrong. Infinite choice in entertainment has ruined the companies which produced middling content that people watched because there was nothing else on\u2014witness the collapse in broadcast-television ratings. But those at the very top of the business have thrived. When anyone can watch anything, people flock to the best. Global streamers like Netflix and Amazon have more than 200m direct subscribers, once an unimaginable number. Those who have fared best at a shrinking box office are the owners of IP that is already popular. As people visit cinemas less often and competition intensifies, studios have pumped money into films people will turn out to see even when they go only three or four times a year. America\u2019s ten biggest films last year were all sequels or parts of a franchise; Disney\u2019s upcoming slate includes an 80-year-old Harrison Ford returning for a fifth outing as Indiana Jones. It has not been a golden age for cinema, but for those at the top it has been a profitable one. Now technology is shaking things up again. Online distribution has enticed tech firms that make the hardware and software used for streaming. Silicon Valley is of a different scale from Tinseltown (Amazon\u2019s growing advertising business is already three times bigger than Disney\u2019s) and its moguls have no need to make money from streaming, which they see as an add-on to their main business. Hollywood initially wrote off the nerds. But the nerds have enough money to take creative risks. Last year Apple won the best-picture Oscar with \u201cCODA\", a comedy-drama partly in sign language, less than three years after it entered the film business. The more fine content these new producers make and sell below cost, the greater the risk that older studios will fall from the top tier of media into the perilous middle. At the same time, new technology is allowing those lower down the \u201clong tail\" a better chance of reaching the profitable top. Inventions like game engines, which help with the creation of virtual sets, are lowering barriers to entry. Generative artificial intelligence, which can already make rudimentary video, may eventually lower them further. The first beneficiaries have been non-American film studios, which until recently struggled to nail first-class special effects. No longer. Two of the world\u2019s highest-grossing films last year were Chinese\u2014and when covid ebbs in China, expect that number to rise. China has yet to convert foreign audiences to hits like \u201cWolf Warrior 2\" (tagline: \u201cAnyone who offends China, wherever they are, must die\"). But don\u2019t bet that this will always be the case. China already has a globally successful social-media app in TikTok and produces video games that are international hits, including Tencent\u2019s \u201cHonour of Kings\", which is the world\u2019s highest-earning mobile game. Perhaps the most dramatic way technology could disrupt the culture business is by creating new categories of entertainment. Young adults in rich countries already devote more time to gaming than to broadcast television. Hollywood has been slow to catch on, but its Silicon Valley rivals are snapping up gaming IP. Microsoft\u2019s proposed acquisition of Activision-Blizzard, whose games include \u201cCall of Duty\" and \u201cCandy Crush\", is worth nearly ten times what Amazon paid for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, home of James Bond and Rocky Balboa. Movies based on games are becoming as popular as games based on movies. A series based on \u201cThe Last of Us\", a post-apocalyptic game, seems to be a critical success. Sonic the Hedgehog was among last year\u2019s biggest films and Mario is likely to be among this year\u2019s. Nintendo is opening a new Mario theme park next month\u2014in Hollywood, no less. The mouse and the long tail The great creative factories of Hollywood will have to adapt if they want to survive. Another successful era is not beyond their reach. Disney\u2019s century has been one of endless reinvention, in business terms as well as artistic ones, as the company has moved its output from projectors to cables to cassettes and now bytes. It will probably continue to innovate. Still, there are already signs that much of the coming century\u2019s popular culture will be dreamt up in places other than Hollywood. For audiences tiring of sequels, that may be a welcome twist.","scraped_date":"2023-01-22"}

A bench led by justices Revati Mohite Dere and Prithviraj Chavan asked Dhoot to pay a surety of  \u20b91 lakh within two weeks. The high court had reserved its order in the matter on 13 January. A detailed order is awaited.

The trio was sent to judicial custody thereafter. Dhoot, currently in judicial custody, had sought quashing of the CBI FIR and release on bail by way of an interim order. In his plea, Dhoot said his arrest by CBI was \u201carbitrary, illegal, done without following due procedure of law and in gross violation of section 41 (A) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which mandates for a notice to be issued to accused to join the probe and to make an arrest only if absolutely necessary.\" Dhoot also said that he was cooperating with the probe and being deeply rooted in India had no plans of absconding.

This technological revolution has markedly affected the finance industry, which has witnessed the emergence of several startups that are leveraging AI and data science to predict cash flow events, assess creditworthiness and detect frauds. Startups using AI are making better data-driven decisions, increasing profits directly by efficient targeting, automating repetitive tasks, and much more to unlock competitive advantages. Consequently, we have made great headway in financial inclusion being able to significantly increase penetration to the previously un-serviced population. Moreover, the global spending on AI is projected to be more than $110 billion by 2024, almost double of the total from 2020. Improved Lending One crucial application of AI in the financial industry is credit scoring. Large banks, fintechs and NBFCs are leveraging AI for the purpose of speeding up processes and accurately assessing potential borrowers. AI and ML use advanced classification algorithms with diverse explanatory variables such as demographical data, income, savings, transaction history, past credit history, their digital footprint and more to decide the creditworthiness of the respective customer. The use of these technologies provides institutions the added advantage of unbiased decision-making, while also enabling borrowers without an extensive credit history to access capital and prove their ability to repay loans. Advanced Algorithmic Trading An intriguing development in algorithmic trading has been the use of AI techniques such as evolutionary computing, deep learning and probabilistic logic. These techniques are helping traders systematically implement and strategise upcoming trades, increasing predictive capacities exponentially. AI-systems are also helping traders track risk exposures, adjust or exit the position depending on the user\u2019s needs in a fully automated manner, eliminating the need for any human intervention. Further, AI and ML systems provide competitive pricing, liquidity management, optimisation and streamline execution for traders, while Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques leveraged in AI-systems allow traders to accurately identify sentiments from sources like Twitter, Reddit, news articles, etc. Preventing Frauds A vast array of machine learning algorithms is designed to prevent fraudulent transactions and for detection of anomalies. The traditional methods of fighting fraud involved sets of hardcoded rules which were designed by domain experts, which then could be discovered and exploited by fraudsters. AI-based solutions can evolve over time and adapt to new patterns found in data pertaining to transactions, such as past behaviour, location, spending patterns and much more, allowing a more secure and protected system which can be used to identify anomalies and trigger warnings. Personalised Banking Experiences Chatbots have become increasingly popular over the past two years, and banking institutions are harnessing the power of AI and advanced NLP techniques to understand the needs of customers. Additionally, banking institutions are also leveraging vast amounts of data to analyse consumers\u2019 spending behavior, while providing tailored financial advice to help them achieve their financial goals. These include tips on how to reduce monthly expenditures, predict recurring transfers in the near future, and much more. The possibilities for improving customer experiences remain endless with the use of AI and ML. Process Automation Automation has been one of the most crucial aspects offered by AI. Simplification of extracting information from documents, digitizing them, and processing forms are just a few examples of what AI-based systems are capable of providing, while optical character recognition can significantly increase efficacy of time-consuming processes. The benefits of using AI-systems can greatly enhance regulatory, supervisory and oversight capabilities for financial institutions. AI, ML and data science are thus providing the financial industry a newfound robustness and resilience, helping them reduce the cost of credit underwriting, adding an extra layer of complexity to algorithmic trading, and providing secure, efficient and transparent ways of functioning. The integration of such innovative technologies is advancing the potential for financial inclusion in the country, bringing forth several opportunities for people to gain financial independence, while improving the quality of products and services available.","scraped_date":"2023-01-22"}

NASA, whose purview also includes aeronautical research, will invest $425 million over seven years in the \"Sustainable Flight Demonstrator\" (SFD) project while Boeing and its partners will spend an estimated $725 million. The goal is to produce future commercial airliners that are \"more fuel efficient, with benefits to the environment, the commercial aviation industry, and to passengers worldwide,\" NASA chief Bill Nelson said. \"If we are successful, we may see these technologies in planes that the public takes to the skies in the 2030s,\" Nelson said in a statement on Wednesday. The agreement calls for NASA and Boeing to build, test, and fly a full-scale single-aisle demonstrator aircraft. \"The technologies demonstrated and tested as part of the SFD program will inform future designs and could lead to breakthrough aerodynamics and fuel efficiency gains,\" Boeing said. Boeing chief engineer Greg Hyslop said it \"has the potential to make a major contribution toward a sustainable future.\" Engineers will be seeking to design an aircraft with fuel consumption and emissions reductions of up to 30 percent relative to today's most efficient single-aisle aircraft, NASA said. The agency plans to complete SFD testing by the late 2020s so the technologies and design can be applied to the next generation of single-aisle aircraft. Single-aisle aircraft are the most common in airline fleets and account for nearly half of worldwide aviation emissions, NASA said. Boeing and NASA plan to flight-test an innovative wing known as the transonic truss-braced wing that creates less drag and results in the burning of less fuel. The extra-long, thin wings are mounted on top of the fuselage and stabilized by diagonal struts. NASA and Boeing said development of the next-generation plane could help meet the White House and industry's objective of net-zero carbon emissions from aviation by 2050.

The conversations at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week highlight a renewed discipline that is guiding investment decisions.  \u201cWhen money was free with 0% interest rates, a lot of companies did invest in crazy pet projects that weren\u2019t core to their mission or core to what they did,\" said David Glazer, finance chief for Palantir Technologies Inc. \u201cNow, money is not free and they\u2019re forced to really think about where they\u2019re investing.\"MINT PREMIUMSee All\n  He said Palantir has been focused on its same core products over the past few years. Still, the tech industry must prepare for tougher times, said Satya Nadella, chief executive of Microsoft Corp., speaking in Davos this week. The company said Wednesday it would shed about 10,000 jobs. \u201cWe in the tech industry will have to get more efficient\u2014it\u2019s not about everyone else doing more with less, we will have to do more with less. We will have to show our own productivity gains,\" he said. Even companies that expanded in the pandemic say they are focused on efficiency. At Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., CEO Marc Casper said employees throughout the life-sciences company must look for ways to make practical improvements to operations. Some employees, for example, tweaked a process to shorten the time it takes to change products on a manufacturing line. \u201cEvery colleague is responsible for making us more effective and more efficient,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a slogan. It\u2019s how we operate, and that\u2019s how we drive productivity.\" As companies focus on profitability, many must also continue to manage higher costs for raw materials. \u201cThere\u2019s no big change yet in inflation,\" said Ilham Kadri, CEO of Belgian chemical company Solvay SA. Executives are trying to set strategies that play \u201coffense and defense at the same time,\" says Bob Sternfels, global managing partner at McKinsey & Co. Technology could help companies figure out how to manage through a slowdown and come out of it in a better position, said Tom Sweet, chief financial officer of computer and services provider Dell Technologies Inc. Company executives who sell products and services that can help automate, interpret, or even pinpoint inefficiencies say they see opportunity, despite the macroeconomic headwinds businesses are facing. \u201cEverybody is looking at efficiency, productivity,\" he said. \u201cCompanies are adjusting cost structures, but they\u2019re also continuing to allocate capital towards growth opportunities or productivity opportunities.\" Part of ServiceNow Inc.\u2019s pitch to clients is that its software can simplify and automate some company processes, and consolidate multiple systems into one. Businesses are receptive, and ServiceNow hasn\u2019t seen a decline in tech spending, said CEO Bill McDermott. \u201cI\u2019m not fighting those headwinds,\" he said. Alexander Rinke, co-CEO of Celonis, a firm he co-founded in 2011 that uses technology to help identify and resolve operational inefficiencies, said executives are focusing on efforts with a quick and clear return. \u201cClearly, we are seeing customers scrutinize their investments more.\" In an effort to cut costs, some companies say they are slowing hiring or eliminating projects, executives said. Others are stressing to teams that they must stay disciplined. Stephen MacMillan, CEO of medical-technology company Hologic Inc., has been urging caution when it comes to hiring, asking managers to consider whether each new role is necessary. \u201cWhat I always tell my team is everybody can always justify another head,\" Mr. MacMillan said. \u201cBut are they being productive against what you really need?\" At real-estate company Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., CEO Christian Ulbrich said the firm now considers where to backfill some positions\u2014with lower-cost markets gaining an edge in some cases. If an employee leaves a finance position in a city with high labor costs, for example, the company could potentially replace that role in Mumbai, India, or in the Philippines, he said.

Following the public confession on Wednesday, GoMechanic\u2019s investors, who said they were unaware of the deception, commissioned a forensic audit of the startup\u2019s financial reports by EY. However, statutory audit reports filed by the company indicate a history of poor financial reporting and weak guardrails in internal financial controls. To be sure, none of these audit reports indicates any financial fraud.   In FY20, PwC\u2019s India affiliate, the auditor of GoMechanic\u2019s holding entity Targetone Innovations Pvt. Ltd, issued a \u2018qualified opinion\u2019, documents accessed by Mint from Registrar of Companies (RoC) show. A qualified opinion indicates the auditor\u2019s inability to give a clean opinion.  PwC\u2019s auditor report said the firm does not \u201cmaintain inventory records for receipts and issuance of goods directly received by the customers (service partner workshops)\".   The auditor also said there was no \u201cformal documentation to map services rendered by the workshops to end-customers with commission invoices raised by the company on the workshops for its B2C (business-to-consumer) customers\". MINT PREMIUMSee All\n  These concerns were addressed by the company and, therefore, did not reflect in the FY21 report, two people with knowledge of the company financials said.  However, in FY22, BSR & Co., an affiliate of KPMG International, issued a \u2018disclaimer on opinion\u2019 in its audit report noting that the \u201ccompany has not established its internal financial controls with reference to financial statements\". BSR audited the company\u2019s statements in FY21 and FY22 and continues to be the auditor on record. There were no qualifications in FY21 and FY22. A disclaimer of opinion indicates the auditor is unable to express an opinion on the financial statements, and does not provide any assurance on their accuracy or fairness. Internal financial controls apply to companies after they hit  \u20b950 crore in revenue, which became applicable for GoMechanic in FY22. GoMechanic reported its FY22 operating income at  \u20b991 crore from  \u20b934 crore in FY21.  On the management and the board\u2019s responsibilities for internal financial controls, the FY22 audit report says: \u201cThese responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company\u2019s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information.\"  The auditor raised the point about internal financial control only in FY22, which was filed in September with the registrar of companies, a person familiar with shareholders\u2019 thinking said, adding that the investor group was not aware of the poor financial controls before the audit report was filed. \u201cThis would have been addressed in FY23 by the board and the investors,\" the person cited above said.  Typically, however, boards do have access to information.  \u201cAuditor qualifications are typically discussed with the management before they are finalized. Sophisticated investors also have information rights as part of investment agreements,\" said Yashojit Mitra, a partner at Economic Laws Practice.  The FY22 audit report also notes that GoMechanic \u201cdoes not have an internal audit system\", though it clarifies that it is not required to have an internal audit system according to the law.  Spokespeople for PwC and BSR declined to comment, while spokespersons for GoMechanic and the investor group did not respond to a request for comment.  Mitra added that any qualifications or critical remarks from the auditor should ideally set into motion changes in the company\u2019s processes. \u201cIf there are red flags in the audit report, one would want to know what were the discussions and the remedial actions taken in the company to address\/mitigate the concerns raised by the auditors,\" he said. Sequoia Capital owns 26.89% of GoMechanic\u2019s holding entity, followed by Orios Venture Partners at 17.1%, Tiger Global at 10.03%, and other investors with a combined 11.2% stake. The company\u2019s founders, Amit Bhasin, Kushal Karwa, Nitin Rana and Rishabh Karwa, together own 25.5% of the company. One allegation centred around Targetone Innovations includes the car service provider\u2019s dealings with a select group of vendors or garages, indicating circular transactions or round-tripping to inflate revenues and misrepresent the actual scale of the business. Faster revenue growth helps companies command a higher valuation.  These allegations came to light when GoMechanic was trying to stitch together a new funding round to raise up to $75 million and was seeking a valuation of $800 million to over a billion. The due diligence led by SoftBank and Khazanah Nasional, the prospective new investors, brought to the fore the alleged irregularities. On Wednesday, the company said it was forced to let go of 70% of its staff because of a cash crunch.  At the end of March, the company\u2019s financial statement reported a cash balance of around  \u20b9119 crore. According to its FY22 financial statement, the company had accumulated losses of  \u20b9205.9 crore till FY22.","scraped_date":"2023-01-22"}

In an interview during his first visit to India as CEO, K\u00e4llenius spoke of the Stuttgart-based luxury carmaker\u2019s view of the Indian market, transition to electric vehicles, and how it is managing the stress on the semiconductor front. Edited excerpts:  How is India positioned in your global business, as many Western markets have slowed down and passenger vehicle market volumes in India continue to rise?  How is India positioned in your global business, as many Western markets have slowed down and passenger vehicle market volumes in India continue to rise?  We have had a less-than-normal situation in the world markets over the last three years with covid-19, semiconductor constraints, the war in Ukraine, effects on the energy market in Europe, and so on and so forth. With all those tests over the last three years, India really came out of the box with a bang and was indeed our fastest-growing market in 2022. On the tech and engineering side, the Mercedes Benz Research and Development Institute in Bangalore is by a wide margin the second biggest engineering and tech hub we have for Mercedes in the world, besides Germany, which means that in every Mercedes, you have a piece of India, on the mechanical side, on the electrical side, and of course, also on the software side which is a particular strength of our engineering team here. We\u2019ve also taken a step into electric production here as an early mover. India, at the moment, is a 3.8 million vehicle market; about 1% is the premium luxury segment, and of that 1%, we are the market leader. In 10 years, that market will be much bigger. On the operational side, at our production site in Pune, we have invested heavily and can at least double the volume.MINT PREMIUMSee All\n  Do you think India can continue on the same pace of growth this year as well? I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that this could be another year of good growth momentum. It\u2019s also fuelled by fantastic products, not just the new electric products, which are hugely important but also refreshing the portfolio in other segments, as well. India is definitely a focal point for us. My first trip in 2023 is to India. India\u2019s economic growth potential over the next 10 years as such is very important, and we will continue to invest, whether on the engineering and innovation and technical side or in terms of the market on the operational side. Mercedes-Benz has committed to selling only EVs in all major markets by 2030. Given the stress in global supply chains and the pressure on sourcing raw materials for batteries, what challenges do you anticipate?  One lesson from the semiconductor supply chain issues we have been battling over the last two-and-a-half years is we have started engaging in more deep sourcing: going beyond tier-I suppliers and looking at the whole value chain, in this case, going down to the chip maker, and even understand beyond the chip maker, to the fab that supplies them. We are on a similar journey for battery raw materials, which will be the most important thing and maybe the biggest industrial task of going towards zero emissions. Switching over an industrial footprint built up over 100 years to a completely new one is a Herculean task. So, we are now engaging all the way down to the source of the raw material and looking at striking agreements in cooperation with tier-I suppliers, needless to say, so that we can protect ourselves because even though there\u2019s enough lithium on earth to solve this problem, can the mining and refining capacity be installed quickly enough to satisfy all the ambitions of all the OEMs? It\u2019s an open question. Next to that, the other factor that will then also decide the adoption rate is charging infrastructure. That is why we decided, as one of the few automakers, on top of things that we have been doing already in consortiums, and we announced this at CES in Las Vegas to embark on a journey to build a high-performance charging network for Mercedes, operated by Mercedes, in our main markets. What\u2019s your outlook on how global economic conditions will emerge? We had inflation as a result of covid-19 supply constraints due to the war in Ukraine and so on. Interest rates have been the response of the federal banks. And, usually, that leads to a cooling-down of the economy. That\u2019s the casualty we can\u2019t escape from. Having said that, there is lots of speculation about whether it is going to be a soft landing or a medium landing. In China, as they come out of covid-19, it seems like the policymakers there are hell-bent on getting the economy really going. The US actually looks a little bit more robust than we thought. So, where there was a tremendous amount of caution and some pessimism some months ago in the economic circles, just reading the news of Davos, where all those economists meet again, we get the sense it\u2019s not going to be as bad as we thought it would be. But it\u2019s prudent to say that we will have a slowdown economically, that we need to deal with us as a company. And let\u2019s hope that it is not a deep slowdown. In India, the macro journey over a longer period of time is growth. Since vehicles still need 28\/65nm chips, etc., how are you diversifying the supply chain for those chips? If I think back to the last 18-24 months, it feels like I\u2019ve had that conversation with my counterpart in more or less every chip company in the world. And that technology is moving into the sub-5nm or even 2nm space. We\u2019ll have to stop using nanometers soon and talk about angstrom instead. We\u2019re using those kinds of chips for the most sophisticated chips that we have. Those are not the chips that have been short. It\u2019s been more in 28nm and above. There are investments going on in that space as well \u2014 that area had been neglected investment-wise for a while, so we were moving into structural issues with or without covid-19. But some of the players know that we will need chips in the higher nanometer categories in many years to come. Some of those investments will come to fruition in this calendar year, 2023, but I believe there will be a gradual migration from higher to lower nanometer categories as well. Do you see the chip manufacturing plants in India as a serious possible prospect for you in the future? When we talk to the political leadership in economic regions \u2014 Europe, the US, China etc. \u2014 our message is that we need both cutting-edge and legacy chips. The \u2018bread and butter\u2019 side of it is needed for many functions. The countries investing most now\u2014 the US is making a very big move, Europe is at least starting to make a move, and of course, Asia has always been there.","scraped_date":"2023-01-22"}

Shoppers looking to snag a luxury timepiece may be tempted by the allure of cut-price products being sold online: a Tag Heuer Mercedes Benz SLR watch, which typically retails at  \u20b94.72 lakh, can be purchased for as little as  \u20b92,500, and an Apple Watch paired with the latest AirPods can be found for just  \u20b92,999. But bargain-seekers beware: these are fakes that rob luxury brands of sales and the government of tax. Besides, these counterfeit products are being promoted by several Indian social media influencers with impunity. Counterfeit luxury products have long been a problem in India, but the peddling of fake items has become more open of late, with little pushback from brands and enforcement authorities. This has resulted in the proliferation of fake products that are often hard to distinguish from the originals, making it increasingly challenging for shoppers to make informed purchases. While most listings of luxury products do not make it to popular e-commerce platforms, a counterfeiter manages to sneak in every now and then. Take, for instance, the seller who runs ShoesKartel. It is retailing, in its catalogue of hundreds of so-called branded products, such as Adidas\u2019 Neo Entrap\u2019 shoe, which otherwise costs upwards of  \u20b910,000 for just  \u20b92,500. When Mint contacted the seller on Whatsapp about the product\u2019s origin, he said these were \u201cimported replicas\". The same seller is also selling products on online B2B marketplace IndiaMart. Most of these fakes are making their way from China. India has become a thriving market for counterfeit luxury goods, with social media influencers contributing to the proliferation of fakes, promoting websites that openly sell and advertise them. Copies or fakes also come with rankings. Copies of big brands like Rolex can be numbered anything from 10A, 9A, 7A, 6A, 5A, etc. If it\u2019s a 12A, it\u2019s the highest quality of copy, while 1A is the lowest. First Copy Club sells everything from fake luxury sunglasses to bags to gadgets and claims most of its products are a 10A copy. This website sells everything from copies of luxury perfumes, such as Burberry, Givenchy, and Giorgio Armani, to sunglasses, belts and accessories from companies like Hermes, Gucci, Versace, Balmain and others. ClassyShopper.selloship. com, which sells everything from luxury sunglasses to perfumes and jackets, claims to have an address in Surat, Gujarat and bears a tagline \u201cMade with love for India\". However, in small print, it says that products are imported and are not sourced from official representatives of the brand in India and don\u2019t carry a warranty. The absence of a specific law that allows the government to remove websites selling counterfeit products is a challenge for luxury brands. However, existing legislation addresses such cases, but implementation remains a challenge as it primarily targets the source of the counterfeit, not its sale. Lawyer Safir Anand said online counterfeiting and endorsement of fake products by social media influencers have proliferated exponentially in recent years and is a menace that needs to be controlled. The consumer protection e-commerce rules mandate that substantial information about the products or vendors must be made available on the seller\u2019s website for the consumer to make an informed buying decision. There are also laws which provide legal protection to brand owners against counterfeiting and infringement of their proprietary rights. Rahul Prasad, managing director (Asia-Pacific and Middle East), Pike Preston Partners Ltd, a boutique advisory firm that deals with mergers and acquisitions in the fashion and luxury segments, said there is a good example in the European Union, Japan and South Korea, where if an individual is importing, carrying or buying counterfeit products, either physically or on e-commerce platforms, they can be liable for a fine regardless of what the source of the product is. Globally, luxury shoe brand Birkenstock which was purchased by LVMH, recently announced in 2016 that it would not sell on Amazon because of counterfeiting. One firm that deals in the business of identifying counterfeits estimates that the luxury counterfeit market has led to a loss of at least  \u20b91 trillion to the Indian economy. Globally, this figure is estimated to be around $3 trillion. E-commerce has proliferated counterfeited goods, and greater internet penetration has fuelled the rapid increase in fake merchandise. Many brands whose products are faked place a high value on their intellectual property and are using tools to identify and take legal action against those who promote counterfeits, said Vikas Jain, founder and CEO at Acviss Technologies, a company that helps identify such products being sold online. But the challenges are aplenty. While online counterfeit dealers are hard to find, and even if they are identified, flagged and removed, they could just as easily start a new website or account. They also use social media to boost their sales, which ordinary customers won\u2019t be able to distinguish from the original. But because the legal system is easy to evade, influencers feel that the benefits of such activities outweigh the risks. The other issue is that these products are not categorized at the same level as the original products, which means they don\u2019t pay the tax the real brands do, leading to tax evasion.","scraped_date":"2023-01-22"}

We are trying to digitize the whole journey for small savings.\" The payments bank, with a deposit base of  \u20b95000 crore, records 5 million transactions per day. It has 60 million customers of which 3.5 million are post office clients. The bank is leveraging India Post\u2019s network of 158,000 outlets to be a universal service provider for banks as well as non-banks. It seeks to offer all financial services to the doorstep of customers with the help of the postman. While regulations do not allow payment bank to offer credit facility, Venkatramu said it is the final goal. \u201cWithin the current regulations we will not be able to fit in. So, this might require a special dispensation via some act or law. Maybe create a special institution we do not have so far, but then it looks like we are heading toward that direction. Probably that\u2019s where a solution lies,\" he said. \u201cWe should be allowed to do micro lending or to convert into an SFB.\" Venkatramu said IPPB will continue to function as a payments bank for at least three years. Under existing rules, state-backed payment banks cannot transition to small savings banks. IPPB is planning to go public within 2-3 years once it reaches networth of  \u20b9500 crore. It is one among 11 payment banks to get a licence in 2015, but started operations in 2018. The delay in breaking even was due to the front loading of costs with a massive hiring programme and branch expansions, Venkataramu said. Nearly 2000 people were hired and 650 branches were set, besides the technology investments involved. The bank even had to redraw its business plans because of the changes in the payment industry, he added. The bank continues to be well capitalised with the infusing nearly  \u20b92000 cr of capital, including the grants. In April this year the government infused  \u20b9650 cr of capital and another tranche of  \u20b9200 cr is yet to be received.","scraped_date":"2023-01-22"}

Earlier in November, Humphries was in Mumbai, and consulted country leadership about the preparations for the fourth quarter board meeting slated for February, for which the board members of the New Jersey-headquartered tech firm were travelling to India.  Unbeknownst to him perhaps, some of those board members were running out of patience with him.  In a surprise move, on 9 January, the board asked Humphries to step down.MINT PREMIUMSee All\n  Three days later, on 12 January, it appointed former Infosys executive S Ravi Kumar as the boss, effective immediately. Just three months ago\u2014in October\u2014Kumar had joined the company as president of the firm\u2019s US business. The board also entrusted Stephen J Rohleder as the chairperson, replacing Michael Patsalos-Fox. Rohleder, a former Accenture executive who joined Cognizant\u2019s board in March last year, played a pivotal role in orchestrating the CEO switch, according to three executives privy to the developments, who asked not to be named. The swiftness and secrecy with which the board acted caught Humphries by surprise. He did not even get a chance to write a farewell note to the employees he had led as CEO since February 2019. Humphries penned a farewell note on LinkedIn. But a torrent of harsh comments from current and former employees poured down on the post. Later, the outgoing CEO disabled comments on the post. It is quite rare for a company of Indian heritage\u2014nearly three-fourths of Cognizant\u2019s 350,000 employees are stationed in the country\u2014to replace both the CEO and chairman. Unlike most of its homegrown rivals, nearly 92% of shares in Cognizant are held by the public and it does not have significant promoter ownership. Mint spoke with seven executives to stitch together this account of what led to the ouster of Humphries and the challenges that face the new CEO as he goes about reviving the firm\u2019s fortunes. All of them asked to not be named as they are not authorized to speak with the media. Cognizant did not respond to queries. Forecast downgrade The straw that broke the proverbial camel\u2019s back was Humphries\u2019 briefing to the company\u2019s board in the first week of January, according to two executives privy to the development. Humphries shared with the board that Cognizant would grow in \u201clow single-digits\" in 2023. Further, he wanted the board to lower the earnings per share (EPS) outlook for 2022. This was because the company had to incur higher capital costs for servicing a large contract from New York-headquartered healthcare client, EmblemHealth. These two developments sealed the fate of the incumbent at Cognizant, which follows a January-December financial year, and paved the way for the dawn of the Ravi Kumar era at the technology services firm. The compensation for the role gives a sense of how high stakes this decision is for the board. Humphries made $19.7 million in 2021. Cognizant ended 2021 with $18.5 billion in revenue and expects to grow 5% in 2022. It will declare its fourth quarter and full-year results on 2 February. \u201cThe majority of the board was disappointed that after three downward revisions in revenue outlook made during the year, the CEO was now sharing that even the profitability would be lower than what the company had outlined in October. Most members concluded that there was no merit in giving the incumbent more time and it was time for a new CEO,\" said the first executive. Cognizant won a $1.2 billion deal from health insurer EmblemHealth in 2016. This contract came up for renegotiation last year. The client sought more savings, according to one executive familiar with the development, and the deal was renewed at a lower value. While that is routine, Cognizant has had to write down some costs associated with servicing this contract. \u201cThe details of our engagement with Cognizant are confidential. So we cannot offer further comment,\" a spokesperson for EmblemHealth said in response to an email seeking comment. Cognizant issued a profit warning in this regard on 12 January, without naming the client. \u201cThe Company now expects full-year 2022 Adjusted Operating Margin of approximately 15.3%, compared to prior guidance of 15.6%, and full-year 2022 Adjusted Diluted EPS of approximately $4.38-$4.40, compared to prior guidance of $4.43-$4.46,\" reads a filing made by Cognizant. \u201cThis updated guidance includes a negative impact on Adjusted Operating Margin of approximately 30 basis points and Adjusted Diluted EPS of approximately $0.08 from the impairment of certain capitalized costs related to a large volume-based contract with a Health Sciences customer. The impairment is principally driven by the Company\u2019s expectation of lower volumes.\" There was more worrying news from some of its marquee clients. Twitter had decided to end its $60 million annual business with Cognizant although much of this was on account of the social media company looking to cut its expenses, according to a second executive. Google\u2019s parent Alphabet, which is Cognizant\u2019s largest client, accounting for some $600 million in annual revenues, was cutting back some business. Ditto for JP Morgan Chase. \u201cThere was no single event that led to these leadership changes but it was all building up over the last year,\" said the second executive. \u201cSome of the board members were questioning Humphries\u2019s leadership. Industry-leading attrition, years of underperformance, and a low growth outlook for the next year (2023) finally made the board act.\" A divided board But it was not that simple as Humphries had the backing of chair Michael Patsalos-Fox and many other independent members. After a review of Cognizant\u2019s performance in the first three months from his induction on the board in March, Rohleder realized that the company would need a new leader. But he was in a quandary as Cognizant did not have an obvious internal leader who could succeed Humphries. Meanwhile, Eric Joseph, a Washington-based partner at executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles, who had helped recruit Humphries in 2018, had identified another senior executive for Cognizant. Sometime in the summer of 2021, the search firm had shortlisted Kumar as an executive who could join Cognizant as a deputy to Humphries, to strengthen the management ranks. \u201cThe first time I met Ravi, and started a dialogue with him, was over 15 months ago. So, this was a long gestation period to try to wine and dine and talk about the possibilities of us working together and what it could do for us here at Cognizant. So he\u2019s been the President of Infosys for six years. They run a very good playbook and I think he brings a very strong growth agenda to Cognizant, which will really help us in North America, which is about $15 billion of our revenue. So, getting more growth in what is three-quarters of our business ultimately helps overall company growth,\" Humphries explained the rationale to hire the Infosys executive at the UBS conference in November last year. As it happened, in May last year, Infosys gave a second five-year term to chief executive Salil Parekh. This move implied that Parekh was assured of running the company until March 2027. For Kumar, 51, this meant that his next shot at the CEO job would be a while away, if at all. Even if he decided to wait, there was no guarantee the board wouldn\u2019t bet on a younger candidate in 2027. By August, he made up his mind to leave Infosys, according to one executive. He met with Rohleder and the Cognizant board member was impressed with Kumar. On 17 October, Cognizant announced that Kumar would join as president of its business in the US, starting 16 January. But a month later, when Cognizant declared its second-quarter earnings, Rohleder was not the only board member who was losing faith in Humphries. At least four other board members, including Maureen Breakiron Evans, Joseph Velli, Leo S Mackay Jr. and John Dineen were questioning Humphries over the company\u2019s underperformance. Together, the five board members finally managed to triumph over Fox, Vinita Bali, Sandra Wijnberg, and Archana Deskus in the fortnight leading up to the 9 January board meeting. It is important to mention that four of the five board members who were not happy with the company\u2019s performance were on the board before Humphries was hired in 2019. Bali, Wijnberg and Deskus were inducted on the board over the last three years. Mint independently could not ascertain another independent director Zein Abdalla\u2019s view. \u201cAfter Humphries was asked to step down, Michael Patsalos Fox realised his continuation as chairman was untenable. This was because he had prevailed upon Francisco D\u2019Souza to appoint Humphries as his successor and not Rajeev Mehta, as suggested by Frank (D\u2019Souza),\" said the second executive cited above. \u201cMicheal was Brian\u2019s biggest supporter over the last three years.\" D\u2019Souza is the Indian-American founder of Cognizant who served as CEO and vice chairman prior to Humphries. The scorecard So how did Cognizant fare under Humphries and was the board right to abruptly end his tenure after he was announced as the first non-founder CEO of the company in February 2019? Three metrics tell us the story. First is Cognizant\u2019s industry-leading attrition. When Humphries started at Cognizant on 1 April 2019, the company had 288,200 employees. The company ended on 30 September with 349,400 employees. During these 14 quarters, Cognizant saw 293,321 employees leave the firm, according to a Mint analysis of the quarterly annualized attrition rates. Put simply: Under Humphries, Cognizant saw one complete round of headcount leaving the firm in less than four years. \u201cSuch large attrition essentially makes clients sit up and take note and question a company. No client is comfortable where there are new faces every three months or so,\" said a fourth executive. \u201cA higher churn starts impacting your ability to keep up with your client\u2019s needs. What will a client do? The client will start working with another IT firm\" Second is the underperformance of Cognizant and this can be best explained by drawing a comparison with Infosys. Cognizant ended with $4.11 billion in revenue in the January-March period of 2019. Its market cap totalled $42 billion as of 1 April 2019. Then, Infosys ended with $3.06 billion in revenue while it was valued at $46.5 billion. Cognizant expects to end with $4.8 billion in revenue in the October-December period, while its market cap declined to $32.6 billion as of 17 January. Infosys ended with $4.66 billion in the third quarter while its market cap jumped to $79 billion. On an annualized basis, Infosys managed to cut its gap with Cognizant from over $4 billion at the start of 2019 to $560 million by the end of 2022. Finally, Humphries struggled to build a stable senior management team: 17 of the 18 senior executives listed in the 2019 annual report have moved out of Cognizant since he took over while over the last 10 months, even senior executives hired by him were heading for the exit. All this eroded investor sentiment as Cognizant shares underperformed tech-heavy Nasdaq: Cognizant shares were down 16% even as the Nasdaq returned 50% between 6 February 2019 and 11 January 2023. The new leader\u2019s path So can Ravi Kumar script a turnaround at the company? It won\u2019t be easy\u2014for three reasons. First is because Kumar has joined a company that appears to have a divided board. \u201cIt is never a wise decision for a leader to join a company that has a divided board. My sense is that the board could see more changes in the coming year with Michael Fox expected to move out of the board in the summer,\" said the second executive cited above. Another unfavourable factor is that he has not been in charge of a business unit or a service offering. At Infosys, Kumar was the president and over the last few years was in charge of the delivery of software services to clients. \u201cIt is not easy to lead a company that has been completely grounded. But the good thing is that even if you take a single, it will be cheered by the people in the stadium,\" said a fourth executive. But the most tricky issue faced by Kumar would be in building a senior management team. Kumar, 51, has been with Infosys for over two decades. Many believe Infosys would have green-lighted his move to join a rival company only after he would have agreed to sign non-solicitation clauses. \u201cWe need to see if Ravi can attract talent from outside Infosys. Infosys would not be very pleased if he takes people from the company and my sense is he would be under scrutiny from his earlier employer. Don\u2019t forget he is also privy to a lot of confidential processes and business decisions at Infosys. So if he seeks to set up development centers for Cognizant in the US, will that classify as a breach of confidential clauses signed with Infosys because he did the same for the company in the last four years? It is subjective and so Ravi will be very careful not to make Infosys upset\" \u201cFor this reason, I believe it will be an interesting dance between Infosys and Cognizant,\" said the fourth executive. For now, Kumar is excited. \u201cFor the first time in my life, I\u2019ve barely slept and I\u2019m more energized than ever,\" Ravi Kumar wrote in a note after he landed in Abu Dhabi for the company\u2019s annual three-day strategy meet which will be attended by nearly 1,100 senior leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s because the opportunity I see before me is incredible. I believe Cognizant\u2019s potential is unlimited.\"","scraped_date":"2023-01-22"}

The HC is hearing the matter on enforcing an arbitration award of  \u20b97,200 crore to Delhi Metro Express. Out of the dues of  \u20b97,200 crore,  \u20b92,600 crore was paid by DMRC. It has outstanding dues of  \u20b94,500 crore.
