The reason behind the free fall in Adani stocks would be Hindenburg Research's allegations over the Group. However, Adani has fought back by giving a much clear picture of its business portfolio.    On Friday, Adani Transmission, Adani Green Energy, and Adani Total Gas closed at 20% lower circuits each. While Adani Power and Adani Wilmar hit 5% lower circuits each. Adani Ports wasn't performing any better and tumbled by over 16% at the end of the day.    Meanwhile, Adani's flagship company, Adani Enterprises, which launched its FPO on Friday, nosedived by around 20% before closing at  \u20b92,762.15 apiece on BSE.    The first day of the FPO saw muted demand across investors.    Under the  \u20b920,000 crore worth FPO, on Friday, only 4,70,160 equity shares were bid against the offered size of 4,55,06,791 equity shares. The price band for the FPO is set from  \u20b93,112 to  \u20b93,276 per FPO equity share for all categories of investors.    If Adani's FPO is fully subscribed, then this will become the second largest follow-on public offer in India after Coal India's  \u20b922,558 crore issue in 2015. Earlier in 2020, Yes Bank had launched a  \u20b915,000 crore FPO.    But circumstances changed drastically a few days before Adani's FPO and it would be Hindenburg Research's report under which it accused Adani of stock manipulation and fraud schemes.    In its report on January 24, the New York-based investment research firm said, \"we reveal the findings of our 2-year investigation, presenting evidence that the  \u20b917.8 trillion ($218 billion) Indian conglomerate Adani Group has engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.\"    Hindenburg's report indicated that Gautam Adani, Founder, and Chairman of the Adani Group, has amassed a net worth of roughly $120 billion, adding over $100 billion in the past 3 years largely through stock price appreciation in the group\u2019s 7 key listed companies, which have spiked an average of 819% in that period.    The findings of Hindenburg's research report on Adani involved interactions with dozens of individuals, including former senior executives of Adani and also reviewing thousands of documents, and conducting diligence site visits in almost half a dozen countries.    Also, the research said, even \"if you ignore the findings of our investigation and take the financials of Adani Group at face value, its 7 key listed companies have 85% downside purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.\"    Adani companies' debt was also among the key factors that Hindenburg pointed out.\u00a0    It said, key listed Adani companies have also taken on substantial debt, including pledging shares of their inflated stock for loans, putting the entire group on precarious financial footing. 5 of 7 key listed companies have reported \u2018current ratios\u2019 below 1, indicating near-term liquidity pressure.    Hindenburg's research note came as a shock and Adani stocks went into frenzied selling.    Although, Adani has denied Hindenburg's accusations.    On January 27th, Adani Enterprises filed a presentation covering Adani Group\u2019s response to Hindenburg Report. It was titled \"Myths of Short Seller\".    Hindenburg is the short seller.\u00a0    According to Adani's presentation, Hindenburg asked 89 questions in total. While some of these questions are in regards to the group's related party transactions, DRI (Directorate of Revenue Intelligence), and court cases. However, there are 21 questions in total that cannot be claimed to be the result of any investigation over a 2-year period or any such assertion as they were disclosed in public documents all the way back from 2015 onwards.    Further, Adani said, 8 of 9 listed companies have a big 6 auditor such as Deloitte Haskins & Sells, SRBC & Co. (EY), SRBC & Co. (EY) & Dharmesh Parikh & Co. (Joint Auditors), Shah Dhandharia & Co., Ernst & Young, PKF, Walker Chandiok & Co. and K S Rao & Co., etc.    Moreover, on the leverage issue, Adani mentioned 100 of its various companies are rated ( these account for nearly 100% of its EBITDA). Also, in regards to revenue or balance sheet being artificially inflated or managed, it said, out of 9 listed companies in Adani portfolio \u2014 6 are subject to specific sector regulatory review for revenue, costs, and capex.    Meanwhile, in terms of governance, 4 of Adani's large companies are in the top 7% of the peer group in Emerging markets or the sector or the world. On LAS position, Adani said, overall promoter leverage is less than 4% of promoter holding.    Earlier, on January 25, Jugeshinder Singh, Group CFO, Adani said, \"We are shocked that Hindenburg Research has published a report on 24 January 2023 without making any attempt to contact us or verify the factual matrix. The report is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless, and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India\u2019s highest courts.\"    \"The timing of the report\u2019s publication clearly betrays a brazen, mala fide intention to undermine the Adani Group\u2019s reputation with the principal objective of damaging the upcoming Follow-on Public Offering from Adani Enterprises, the biggest FPO ever in India,\" Singh added.    Also, on January 26, Jatin Jalundhwala, Group Head - Legal, Adani said, \"the maliciously mischievous, unresearched report published by Hindenburg Research on 24 Jan 2023 has adversely affected the Adani Group, our shareholders, and investors. The volatility in Indian stock markets created by the report is of great concern and has led to unwanted anguish for Indian citizens.\"    Nevertheless, the panic selloffs in these seven stocks have led to a massive correction in Gautam Adani's net worth. Asia's richest man's wealth is to the tune of $92.7 billion as of January 28. As per Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Adani's net worth has dropped by $20.8 billion at the latest. However, year-to-date, Adani's wealth has dipped by $27.9 billion.    \u00a0 Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks. It'll just take a moment.

The second largest US oil producer's adjusted net profit for 2022 exceeded its previous record set in 2011 by about $10 billion. Still, higher expenses and weaker oil and fuel profits left fourth-quarter earnings 6.6% below Wall Street's forecast, according to Refinitiv data.    Chevron shares were down 3.9%.    Its results kick off what promises to be nosebleed level earnings for global energy suppliers. High prices from strong demand and shortages since Russia's invasion of Ukraine position Western energy firms to show a combined $200 billion profit for the year, according to analysts.    This season's earnings have already put energy stocks at the top of industry returns as more companies lift their payouts to shareholders. The record shareholder payouts could stir fresh calls for windfall taxes.    \"We made progress winning back investors to energy and 2022. We still have a long way to go,\" finance chief Pierre Breber told Reuters in an interview.    The industry has potential to significantly increase its participation in the S&P index, even with modest production growth.    The White House on Wednesday protested Chevron's decision to triple its spending on share repurchases, now at $75 billion over five years at current guidance. The Biden administration wants companies to lower prices for consumers.    \"The billions that Chevron earned in 2022 will seem like a slap in the face\" for Americans struggling to repair damages after floods earlier this month, said Jonathan Noronha-Gant, an environmental campaigner at Global Witness.  SHAREHOLDER PAYOUTS    Shareholder rewards will continue to be the top priority for cash, Chevron officials said.    \"We can do it all,\" Breber said. After providing for shareholder dividends, Chevron will allocate cash to production and repaying debt, with share buybacks a fourth priority.    \"I'm going to keep doing what we have been doing, year in and year out,\" he said.    Despite the furor over the buyback target, Chevron's spending on its own shares will be \"unchanged at $5 billion to $15 billion per year\", Breber said.    \"The $75 billion can be thought of as five years at the current buyback rates,\" he said.    Chevron last year paid out $26 billion via dividends and buybacks to shareholders and invested $15.7 billion in operations.    This year, it will increase project expenditure to $17 billion, with two-thirds of outlays in the United States, where oil and gas output was up 4% over 2021.    It left global oil and gas production guidance for this year at flat to up 3%.  FOURTH-QUARTER MISS    In the final quarter, Chevron posted adjusted earnings of $7.9 billion, or $4.09 per share, below analysts' estimate of a $4.38 per share profit.    \"The miss was primarily driven by higher corporate costs, with both the upstream and downstream coming in a touch below market expectations,\" said Biraj Borkhataria, European research director at RBC Capital.    Oil and gas production was down for the year, led by a 7% decline in international output due to the end of concessions in Thailand and Indonesia.    But Chevron has been shifting its focus for new investments and targeting production in the United States. U.S. production hit a record last year, led by a 16% increase in Permian, the country's main shale basin.    Its refining business picked up and almost tripled results from the previous year as international fuel production delivered stronger margins. Refined product sales were up 7%, led by higher renewable fuel sales and jet demand. This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

The company, which owns dozens of high-end labels including fashion houses Louis Vuitton and Dior, late on Thursday reported that its sales rose 9% in the fourth quarter as shoppers in Europe and the United States splurged over the holiday season, helping partly to offset COVID-19 disruptions in China.    But some analysts focused on the margins, taking some of the shine off the fourth-quarter sales boost.    \"The slight wrinkle is on the margin, where the group delivered a flat operating margin year-on-year (versus consensus of +90 bps) \u2013 largely a reflection of maintaining\/raising H2 marketing spend despite disrupted revenue growth,\" Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note.    The shares fell initially on Friday but were up about 0.6% by 0956 GMT.    LVMH chief financial officer Jean Jacques Guiony said on Thursday the company had decided to maintain marketing investments in the second half at a level of 30% higher than the previous year despite lower revenue growth, but had not expected such a sharp decline in business in China in December.    High profile marketing events included Dior's takeover of London department store Harrods over the holidays as well as a fashion show in Egypt, with the pyramids serving as a backdrop.    Guiony also said that LVMH's strategy of curbing parallel channels for its perfumes and cosmetics division was \"a costly decision\" that drove down profitability, but that it was \"the right decision\" and would protect the appeal of its labels.    Parallel channels are where retailers sell branded products at a discount.    Guiony said that over the past two years, rivals had been shipping large quantities of perfumes and cosmetics to China where they were being sold at a discount.    \"We think that, to preserve capital, this is not a good idea -- so we don't do this,\" he said.    The division's profit from recurring operations came to 660 million euros ($718.61 million) for the year, a fall of 3%.    Rogerio Fujimori, analyst with Stifel, said the reasons for the margin miss were \"net positive\" for the coming year, as the step-up in marketing spending should translate into stronger top line growth while the sales shortfall in China should be recovered.    The luxury industry took a hit in China at the end of the year due to lockdowns, followed by a surge in infections when they were lifted. Now, the luxury industry is expected to be one of the biggest winners from the loosening of restrictions that kept shoppers out of stores in China for months.

Now, the Detroit rivals must convince investors that last year's profit formula can keep working when costs for EV batteries are rising, high interest rates are cutting consumer purchasing power, and Tesla Inc is slashing prices.    Already there are signs the Detroit automakers are scaling back spending to offset competitive and economic pressure. GM has shelved for now plans to build a fourth EV battery plant in North America.    Ford is in talks with German unions to cut thousands of jobs in its European operations and possibly sell a German vehicle assembly plant. In October, it stopped funding autonomous vehicle affiliate Argo AI.    GM and Ford both rely on sales of pickup trucks and SUVs in the United States for the bulk of their global profits. This year, both automakers plan to ramp up sales of much less profitable electric vehicles in North America and other markets.    The risk to the Detroit automakers' profitability would be a challenge in the best of times. But now, GM and Ford must factor in forecasts for a slowdown, or even a recession, in the U.S. economy.    EV battery raw material costs are rising, but U.S. EV market leader Tesla is cutting prices on its best-selling Model 3 and Model Y vehicles by as much as 20%.    The Model Y SUV competes with Ford's Mustang Mach-E, GM's Cadillac Lyriq EV, and with combustion SUVs the Detroit automakers sell.    Morgan Stanley estimated increased prices added an average of $3 billion a year to Ford's pre-tax bottom line and was the equivalent of more than 200% of the improvement in the company's pre-tax profits for 2022.    GM, the No. 1 U.S. automaker by sales in 2022, said higher prices added $2.1 billion to pre-tax profits in the third quarter compared to the same quarter in 2021 - equivalent to nearly half of pre-tax profits for the period overall.    The company has told investors it will spend $35 billion on electric and automated vehicles between 2020 and 2025. Ford has put its planned EV investments at $50 billion through 2026.    \"If we are entering a downturn,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said, \"what steps can they take to keep investing and remain strong?\"\u00a0 This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

The company predicted a surprise loss for the first quarter and its revenue forecast was $3 billion below estimates as it also struggled with slowing growth in the data center business.    Intel shares closed 6.4% lower, while rival Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia ended the session up 0.3% and 2.8%, respectively. Intel supplier KLA Corp settled 6.9% lower after its dismal forecast.    \"No words can portray or explain the historic collapse of Intel,\" said Rosenblatt Securities' Hans Mosesmann, who was among the 21 analysts to cut their price targets on the stock.    The poor outlook underscored the challenges facing Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger as he tries to reestablish Intel's dominance of the sector by expanding contract manufacturing and building new factories in the United States and Europe.    The company has been steadily losing market share to rivals like AMD, which has used contract chipmakers such as Taiwan-based TSMC to make chips that outpace Intel's technology.    \"AMD's Genoa and Bergamo (data center) chips have a strong price-performance advantage compared to Intel's Sapphire Rapids processors, which should drive further AMD share gains,\" said Matt Wegner, analyst at YipitData.    Analysts said that puts Intel at a disadvantage even when the data center market bottoms out, expected in the second half of 2022, as the company would have lost even more share by then.    \"It is now clear why Intel needs to cut so much cost as the company's original plans prove to be fantasy,\" brokerage Bernstein said.    \"The magnitude of the deterioration is stunning, and brings potential concern to the company's cash position over time.\"    Intel, which plans to cut $3 billion in costs this year, generated $7.7 billion in cash from operations in the fourth quarter and paid dividends of $1.5 billion.    With capital expenditure estimated to be around $20 billion in 2023, analysts said the company should consider cutting its dividend.

The 24 January Hindenburg's report details a web of Adani-family-controlled offshore shell entities in tax havens, from the Caribbean, Mauritius, and the United Arab Emirates. It claims these were used to facilitate corruption, money laundering, and taxpayer theft while siphoning money from the group\u2019s listed companies.    Naturally, the Adani Group has denied the claims by Hindenburg and said the report is \"a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless, and discredited allegations\".    Hindenburg said it had taken a short position in Adani\u2019s companies through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments.    The Adani Group is now considering taking legal action against Hindenburg Research. \u201cWe are evaluating the relevant provisions under US and Indian laws for remedial and punitive action against Hindenburg,\" Adani group's legal head said in a statement.    On the other hand, market regulator Sebi has also increased scrutiny of deals by the Adani Group over the past year.    Meanwhile, a major concern has been raised regarding the exposure of LIC and SBI in Adani Group's stocks.    Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said that the high exposure of financial institutions such as the Life Insurance Company of India (LIC) and the State Bank of India (SBI) to the Adani Group has implications for financial stability and for the crores of Indians whose savings are stewarded by these pillars of the financial system.    The Congress leader claimed that \"As much as 8% of LIC's equity assets under management, amounting to a gigantic sum of  \u20b974,000 crore, is in Adani companies and comprise its second-largest holding\".    Alleviating the concerns of lakhs of investors, SBI Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said, \"There is nothing alarming about our Adani exposure and we don't have any concerns as of now\".    He said that the Adani Group hadn't raised any funding from SBI in the recent past and that the bank would take a \"prudent call\" on any funding request from them in the near future.    Another SBI official told Reuters news agency, \"Our exposure to the Adani Group is below the large exposure framework of the Reserve Bank of India\".    The Union Bank of India was not seeing any stress from their exposure to the conglomerate either, an official at the bank said, also speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter was private.    According to Jefferies, the Adani Group's debt accounts for 0.5% of total loans across the Indian banking sector. For public sector banks, the debt is at 0.7% of total loans and for private banks, it is at 0.3%.

These will comprise 21 Airbus A320, four Airbus A321, five Boeing B777-200LR widebody aircraft and six Boeing B777-300 ER jets.     In a speech to airline employees, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Campbell Wilson said the turnaround of Air India is \u201cone of the most ambitious turnarounds in international aviation history.\" \u201cMore than our successes, it is how we respond to our lapses that will define us,\" Wilson said.     The airlines under the Air India umbrella are in the process of moving to a centralised work space in Gurugram by mid-2023. The group umbrella now includes budget carriers Air India Express, AirAsia and full-service carriers Air India and Vistara.    The airline is also finalising a historic order of new aircraft, Wilson said, adding that Air India will also shortly introduce an enhanced menu on its international routes.

The rout in Adani shares also impacted stocks of state-owned and private lenders with an exposure to the group, fuelling the fall in the benchmark indices, Nifty and Sensex, to three-month lows.     The rout in Adani shares also impacted stocks of state-owned and private lenders with an exposure to the group, fuelling the fall in the benchmark indices, Nifty and Sensex, to three-month lows.     Adani Enterprises, the flagship of the Adani Group, dismissed the report as \u201cunresearched\" and \u201cmaliciously mischievous,\" which seeks to undermine the \u201cgoodwill and reputation of the Adani group and its leaders and sabotage the FPO (follow-on public offering) from Adani Enterprises,\" a day after its release on Thursday.     However, six of the 10 Adani group stocks hit the lower circuits before recouping some losses on Friday, while four that don\u2019t have price bands \u2013 Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports, Ambuja Cements and ACC \u2013 fell between 12% and 18%. The rout in Adani stocks helped rival Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd, reclaim the title of the richest Indian he ceded to billionaire Gautam Adani last year.     The fall in the Adani Group stocks saw investor wealth worth  \u20b93.19 trillion get wiped off and took the two-day loss since the Hindenburg Research report surfaced on Wednesday to  \u20b94.4 trillion. Adani Group stocks\u2019 market value loss accounted for 47% of the overall  \u20b96.98 trillion loss of investor wealth on Friday.     Adani Ports and Adani Enterprises, part of the Nifty, crashed by 15% and 18% each. Jittery investors also offloaded bank stocks such as State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and IndusInd Bank, which fell between 4% and 5%. The 18% fall in Adani Enterprises to  \u20b92,768.50 apiece took it below the lower band of the FPO\u2019s floor price of  \u20b93,112.     The cascading effect on the bank stocks dragged down the benchmark indices. The Nifty plunged by 1.61% to 17,604.35, while the Sensex shed 1.45% to close at 59,330.90. The 12-constituent of Bank Nifty fell 3.13% to 4,0345.30.     Investors\u2019 nervousness was reflected in the fear gauge, India Vix, surging 18% to 17.32.     The Adani Group released a presentation through its flagship Adani Enterprises to the stock exchanges after market closing on Friday, with its responses to Hindenburg\u2019s questions.     It said that eight of the group\u2019s listed companies were audited by the Big 6, including Deloitte Haskins & Sells and EY.     Earlier in the day, American billionaire and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman weighed in on the matter through a tweet wherein he described the Hindenburg report as \u201chighly credible and extremely well researched.\"     Proxy advisory firm InGovern also weighed in on the issue stating, \u201cHindenburg, as a short seller, should be considered as just another participant who has a motivated view to release a negative report with the aim to bring down the stock price.\"     A Sebi official said that the regulator would wait for the clarification by the company to the exchanges before deciding the further course of action. The official declined to be identified.     Corporate houses with heavy leverage or expensive valuations were hit the most during this selloff on Friday, said Nishit Master, portfolio manager, Axis Securities.     Foreign portfolio investors\u2019 (FIIs) cautious stance ahead of the Union Budget and US Federal Open Market Committee meetings also contributed to the collapse in the markets. FIIs sold shares worth a provisional  \u20b95,977.86 crore, while domestic institutional investors purchased  \u20b94,252.33 crore worth of stocks on Friday. FIIs have sold  \u20b913,206 crore worth of equity till 25 January.     Amid the gloom, the one silver lining was India on Friday became the first country in the world to have a T+1 settlement cycle. The faster settlement cycle is expected to augur well for the Indian equity markets from a liquidity perspective, with settlements being made within 24 hours.     The shift will boost operational efficiency as the rolling of funds and stocks will be faster, said Ajay Menon, managing director and CEO of broking and distribution at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.     The same will help the investor in reducing the overall capital requirements with the margins getting released on T+1 day. Sellers will get funds in their bank accounts within 24 hours of the sale.  ujjval.j@livemint.com Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

With this, India has surpassed countries such as Kuwait, Ireland, Bahrain, Belgium, Portugal, Greece, and Malaysia in luxury watch imports.       New Delhi: Demand for luxury watches in India has soared, with Swiss watch imports nearly doubling in 2022 from 2020, the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry said.    Watch distributors in India imported luxury watches worth Swiss franc 187.6 million ($200 million) last year, rising from Swiss franc 97 million in 2020.     Imports have grown 19% over 2021. With this, India has surpassed countries such as Kuwait, Ireland, Bahrain, Belgium, Portugal, Greece, and Malaysia in luxury watch imports.    Despite the sharp increase, the waiting period for some of the most desirable watches, including Rolex and Patek Philippe, is still about six months. And while a lot of this demand is said to be fuelled by an artificial shortage being created by luxury brands themselves, several collectors accept that they never stopped buying luxury watches during the pandemic.    Ashok Goel, founder of Delhi-based Luxury Time Pvt. Ltd, a distributor of brands such as Hublot, Tag Heuer, Zenith and Bomberg, confirmed the trend is true for their products as well. The company, he said, is reporting 50% more business than it did in 2019 and 250% more business than it did in 2020.    \u201cSeveral brands across the world, especially the well-established and highly desirable Swiss companies, are currently focused on making and selling more high-end collectable watches directly from their own monoband retail boutiques,\" he said.     This is primarily because the super-rich never stopped buying collectable luxury watches during the pandemic, and the more unique the watch was, the more collectable it became.    Luxury watch retailer Kapoor Watch Co., the Indian retailer of Bvlgari, Cartier, Omega and Tag Heuer brands, also saw an uptick in business last year.     Pratiek Kapoor, the company\u2019s head of marketing, said India\u2019s purchasing power for luxury goods has increased tremendously during the pandemic.     The company is adding not just newer clients but their existing clients are also trading up and buying more now.     \u201cExisting buyers are trading up with more high-end pieces. Also, newer clients are continuing to enter the fold,\" he said.     The major growth is primarily being driven by products in the price range of  \u20b98-16 lakh.    Late last year, Swiss luxury watchmaker Franck Muller launched a watch collection exclusively for the Indian market, priced between  \u20b98-20 lakh.    But one of the top distributors of luxury watches in the country cautioned that the sharp increase in sales of luxury watches could be due to certain factors.    The Chinese have been largely absent from the global luxury consumption market in the last couple of years; as a result of this, several international companies have renewed their focus on India.     The Swiss luxury watch industry could also be gaining in terms of value from the dollar strengthening and the rupee devaluing.     \u201cThe prices of luxury watches have increased by 25%. But the overall demand for luxury products in India has gone up. Just like other asset classes, Indians are now seriously investing in luxury watches,\" said Nitin Chainani, CEO of Swiss Promotion Pvt. Ltd, a firm that distributes luxury watches here.    And it is no surprise that passion investments that are likely to be made in 2023 showed a high percentage of growth in the Indian context.     According to a recent report, titled The Wealth Report: Outlook 2023, by Knight Frank, Indians were more likely to buy luxury watches as compared to their Asia-Pacific and other global counterparts in the ultra high-net-worth individual category. As much as 53% of Indians are likely to purchase luxury watches compared to 48% Asia-Pacific and 46% global counterparts.    \u201cThe proposition of investible wealth towards passion investments changed in the last four to five years. Today, since 2018, when Indians spent 3% of their wealth on these types of investments, there has been a 1% increase. Luxury watches, for instance, which are relatively better to store, transact with and resell, compared to others, are highly investable for this asset class of people,\" said Vivek Rathi, senior vice-president of research at Knight Frank India.

Ltd on Friday said it has laid off 100 employees, or around 6% of its 1,500-workforce, across several verticals as part of a corporate realignment process.     \u201cAs part of our business restructuring plan and to sustain growth, we have taken a difficult decision to reduce the size of the team by 100 employees which constitutes only 6% of the company. We have taken adequate measures to compensate the affected employees,\" a company statement said.     Layoffs at the social commerce startup were undertaken across functions, the company said.     The realignment plan comes amid challenging macroeconomic conditions, which, as per the firm\u2019s founder and co-chief executive Sourjyendu Medda, are likely to continue in the near term. \u201cWe have toned down the business plan a bit in terms of geographical expansion, and the newer spheres of the business that we were going to invest into,\" Medda said.    The firm looks to pare down expenses from those parts of its operations which \u201ccould lead to longer periods of cash infusion and investments, before becoming profitable.\" The firm aims to realign its operations, particularly in Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, which were among the recently launched geographies, as a measure to contain its costs. It currently operates in 150 cities.     The firm will provide a notice period of about three months to the laid off employees, along with out-placement support. Medda said the company may offer and extension to the notice period to employees unable to secure a job offer at the end of the three-month period.     At its peak during March-April 2022, the company\u2019s ARR (annual revenue run rate) stood at about $900 million, from which it has dropped by about one-thirds about to $600 million, after the company reduced its cash monthly burn by about two-thirds.     Even as the chief executive remained confident on the firm\u2019s revenue growth, which stood at about  \u20b91933 crore at the end of financial year (FY) 2022, the firm may not be able to break even by FY23 end, he said. Dealshare incurred a  \u20b967 crore loss at the end of FY22.     With this, the firm joins the long list of startups laying off their employees amid a challenging macroeconomic environment. In 2022, over 19000 were laid off across Indian startups, while this year, over 2600 have already been sacked for a multitude of reasons including corporate restructuring, cost-cutting, or performance review.     This week saw layoffs particularly in the healthcare sector. Among the latest was SirionLabs, which fired about its 130 staff to realign business operations, followed by Innovaccer, laying off around 245 employees citing a similar reason. InMobi also cut 70 jobs as part of its performance review.     DealShare joined the coveted unicorn club early last year after raising almost $130 million as a part of its Series E funding round from Tiger Global Management, Alpha Wave Global and others.

A 26 January CLSA report, titled Adani\u2014Where does the debt sit?, said Indian banks\u2019 exposure is under 40% of total group debt, with private banks\u2019 share plummeting from 31% to 8% and public sector banks\u2019 share falling from 55% to 26%.    CLSA estimates that the group has a bank debt of  \u20b970,000-80,000 crore out of the total  \u20b92 trillion of debt at the end of FY22. While the group\u2019s debt levels have doubled to  \u20b92 trillion in three years, the group\u2019s bank debt has increased only by 25%. A greater part of the group\u2019s funding now comes from bonds at 37% and foreign banks at 18% of the debt.     Shares of Indian banks and Life Insurance Corp. of India plunged on Friday amid concerns about their exposure to the Adani Group following the report. The NSE Bank Nifty Index fell 3.13% to 40,345.30, extending declines from the previous session. Bank of Baroda and State Bank of India were among the major losers, falling at least 5% each. LIC\u2019s shares ended 3.4% lower at  \u20b9665.95 apiece.    Hindenburg Research, which in the past has shorted electric truck maker Nikola Corp., said it holds short positions in Adani companies through US-traded bonds and non-India traded derivative instruments.    \u201cPrivate banks\u2019 exposure is below 10% of total group debt, and most banks (including ICICI, Axis) have indicated that they have largely financed assets with strong cash flows, such as airports\/ports. PSU banks do have material exposure (30% of group debt), but this debt has not increased in the past three years. Most of the incremental funding to the group for new businesses and acquisitions has come via overseas sources,\" CLSA said in its report.    \u201cWe estimate that incrementally, banks have only lent  \u20b915,000 crore, or 15% of the  \u20b91 trillion the group companies have borrowed over the past three years. Large acquisitions, such as cement, have been fully funded by foreign banks,\" CLSA added.    Jefferies, too, noted limited risk for banks due to their exposure to Adani group companies.     \u201cFrom the banking sector\u2019s perspective, debt to this group forms 0.5% of total loans\u20140.7% for PSU banks and 0.3% for private banks. Our recent conversation with industry participants also indicated that cash-flows and repayment timelines of debt had been conservatively planned. Hence, DSCR (debt service coverage ratio) could be even better. While we watch for developments here, we don\u2019t see material risk arising to the Indian banking sector,\" Jefferies said.

NEW DELHI :      Demand for athleisure and casual clothing will continue growing in line with the post-covid trend that has held strong despite the return of festive clothing and occasion wear in the December quarter, retailers said.    Companies said the trend points to consumers finding more comfort in casual wear and also mixing day-to-day pieces with formal clothing.    In the December quarter, department store chain Shoppers Stop saw strong demand for casual wear, despite an increase in demand for wedding wear and festive clothing. \u201cI think if we look at the whole casual space, that has expanded and continues to grow. Even during the third quarter, where festive was a strong category, casual wear grew. The casualization trend that has happened (post-covid) will continue to be strong. Athleisure is a subset\u2014that I think will definitely continue to grow because the base itself is low. It\u2019s eventually about comfort and that\u2019s something which customers have gotten used to,\" said Venu Nair, managing director and chief executive officer, Shoppers Stop.    Casualization as a trend within apparel will continue to remain strong, Nair said.    Jubi Samuel, senior director, category management, sports at Myntra said that athleisure is now \u201cwell ingrained\" in people\u2019s everyday wear. With more and more brands focusing on inclusive sizes, any-wear and all-day stylized comfort wear, this segment is poised to grow further, said Samuel.    On Thursday, Myntra announced the launch of Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar\u2019s fashion brand Force IX on its platform. The brand will sell t-shirts, sweatshirts and caps targeted towards consumers looking for street wear and casual wear.     \u201cAthleisure as a category (apparel and accessories) has witnessed a steady growth in demand from customers including from metros as well as tier-2 cities and beyond, with increasing focus and enthusiasm for fitness particularly since the pandemic. Interestingly, the growth of athleisure for women is faster than for men,\" Samuel said.     Samuel said the platform is seeing leading brands in this segment betting big on women\u2019s athleisure and getting a lot of colour and print elements incorporated in their assortment.     \u201cWe are confident about the category continuing the momentum for calendar year 2023 with customers coming in from both metros, as well as smaller towns and cities,\" Samuel added.    The pandemic also took away the dominance of formal clothing as consumers swapped office shirts with causal t-shirts and joggers to stay at home for extended periods.     However, even prior to the pandemic, athleisure clothing such as leggings, tights, sweatpants, sneakers, hoodies, and jackets was established in popularity. Covid further accelerated the trend.     It helps that India\u2019s demographic is also largely young, comfortable in joggers and sneakers at malls and cafes.    The pandemic also stoked consumer interest in health and fitness. This, in turn, is prompting consumers to buy more leggings, tracks and jackets.     At New Delhi\u2019s popular Select Citywalk Mall, athleisure and sporting good stores have continued to do brisk business, growing ahead of 2019 levels. The mall has over a dozen brands that retail sneakers, fitness clothing, sporting goods as well as other athleisure assortments. These include Nike, Adidas, Puma and Decathlon.    Yogeshwar Sharma, CEO and executive director, Select Citywalk, said: \u201cFitness as a category is not going down and that will continue\u2014 things like sporting equipment and sporting goods will grow at a fast pace. It is because of covid that this category has gained momentum. For us, four categories including athleisure, beauty, electronics and watches are the key focus areas,\" he said.

The FPO received bids for only 470,000 shares against an offer size of 45.5 million shares, stock exchange data showed.    To be sure, the first-day subscription figures are a poor indicator of the demand for a share sale, as these share sales typically draw the lion\u2019s share of investor demand on the final day of the offering.

On Friday, Adani Enterprises shares plunged 18.5% to  \u20b92,762.15 on BSE, trading below the lower end of the FPO offer price.

The anchor investors, 33 in total, included foreign and domestic institutional investors such as Maybank Securities Pte Ltd, Life Insurance Corp. of India, SBI Employees Pension Fund, SBI Life Insurance Co., HDFC Life Insurance Co, Abu-Dhabi-based sovereign wealth fund ADIA, Goldman Sachs Investment and Morgan Stanley Asia.    \u201cIt is still too early to say. It is becoming too hot for people to put in money, but the group still has a lot of influence with institutional investors to ensure sufficient demand for the offer to be successful,\" said a market expert, speaking on the condition of anonymity.    Meanwhile, Adani group has denied several of the allegations made in the Hindenburg Research report released ahead of the opening of the FPO, according to a presentation made by the Adani group.    The Adani group said 21 questions (related-party transactions and court cases) are nothing but Adani portfolio\u2019s public disclosure from as far back as 2015. Hindenburg had sent the group 89 questions as part of its research into the group. Mint has seen a copy of the presentation. \u201cHindenburg asked 89 questions in total...21 in total cannot be claimed to be a result of any investigation over a two-year period or any such assertion as they were disclosed in the following public documents all the way back from 2015,\" the presentation said.    The presentation added that the accounting (or fraud-type assertions) \u201cinvestigation\" was devoid of facts. \u201cOf Adani portfolio\u2019s nine public listed entities, eight are audited by one of the Big 6,\" it said.    On the issue of leverage, the group said 100 of its firms are rated by three global and seven domestic rating agencies, with this accounting for nearly 100% of its Ebitda.    On revenue or balance sheet being artificially inflated, the group retorted that out of nine listed firms in Adani portfolio, six are subject to specific sector regulatory review for revenue, costs and capex. \u201cIn addition to accounts, Sebi, BSE or NSE requirements, six of our listed entities are also obliged to provide regular filings for business regulators. In these cases, revenue claimed expenses and claimed capital expenses are independently reviewed by the regulators as part of the relevant legislation, e.g. Electricity Act,\" the presentation noted.

Seven hundred companies, including financial services giant Paytm, have already signed up on ONDC, while 300 are in various stages of integration, the person said on the condition of anonymity.     Also, companies such as ITC Ltd are building seller services for ONDC, according to the company\u2019s website. IDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and payments firm PhonePe, are other big brands that are set to integrate with the network. The person added that 5,000 merchants are already part of ONDC.    The ONDC network aims to break hegemonies in the e-commerce industry. It does so by creating a common registry of buyers, sellers, logistics and tech service providers, among others, which all stakeholders can access. This prevents any one operator from controlling the market by limiting access to buyers by creating walled gardens.    JioMart is owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Jio Platforms Ltd. The company also partnered with WhatsApp and allows consumers to place orders through the messaging service. In its earnings report earlier this month, the company said orders on WhatsApp were up 37% monthly.    To be sure, this won\u2019t be the first integration that Reliance has done with the network. In August, Reliance Retail-owned logistics platform Grab.in went live on ONDC. A spokesperson for Reliance Jio did not respond to a request for comment.    ONDC officially went live in September, with a pilot launch in Bengaluru. It has since started running alpha tests in 84 cities and is in beta in two cities\u2014Bengaluru and Meerut. Alpha tests are being run in Noida, Faridabad, Lucknow, Bijnor, Bhopal, Chhindwara, Kolkata, Pune, Chennai, and Kannur.    Logistics unicorns Dunzo, Delhivery and Shiprocket have already joined the platform. Paytm and Meesho have e-commerce integrations, with Flipkart and Amazon expected to join later.     A report by the non-profit think-tank Digital India Foundation (DIF), published in November, said ONDC may reach 250 million users by 2027.    In December, T. Koshy, managing director and chief executive of ONDC, said the company might charge a \u201csmall fee\" from platforms in future. He didn\u2019t specify when this would begin, however.    The person also said that the source code for a reference ONDC app would be put up on the Microsoft-owned code repository GitHub within a few weeks. While ONDC is not a platform like the unified payments interface (UPI) or account aggregator (AA), platforms can still build ONDC-compliant apps.     The reference app to be put up on GitHub will allow any developer to gain access to the basic source code required to build such an app. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

{"news_link":"https:\/\/www.livemint.com\/companies\/news\/chemical-firms-face-demand-woes-though-cost-stress-eases-11674839842820.html","pub_date":"2023-01-27T22:49:56+05:30","title":"Chemical firms face demand woes though cost stress eases","keywords":"chemical industry,chemical manufacturer,companies,china,prices,q3 results,agriculture","articles":"Demand for agrochemicals remained steady but channel inventories in some regions worry       Despite strong long-term growth drivers, the Indian chemical industry is facing pressure from rising raw material prices, logistics issues and supply-side constraints, as well as demand concerns because of the economic slowdown in Western markets.    Some respite, however, is now being provided by China, which has eased longstanding covid curbs. Lower oil prices are another positive, as it helps ease raw material prices and supplies. Even shipping rates and container availability have improved over time. Strong domestic demand for chemicals is another major positive.    However, analysts remain cautious and watchful about the impact of the global slowdown amid lingering recession worries.    Analysts feel that while the pace of rate hikes and inflation are falling, the interest rate hike cycle may continue for some time and inflation is still much higher than the 2% targeted by developed economies such as the US.    Prahalathan Iyer, chief general manager (research and analysis) at the Export-Import Bank of India, said recessionary concerns may lead to caution prevailing for about two quarters more. He, however, kept a positive view of the prospects of the Indian chemical industry.    Trade data across India, China and the US reflect weakness engendered by an economic slowdown. Consequently, export revenues of Indian companies, particularly those exposed to cyclical end-users, are under pressure, said analysts at Kotak Securities Ltd.    India\u2019s exports and imports of organic and inorganic chemicals trended lower from a year ago in December 2022. Exports fell 6.6% from a year ago (although they rose 9.8% sequentially compared with a depressed base), while imports fell 20.4% from a year ago (down 0.5% sequentially) in US dollar terms, as per Kotak.    Even trade data from the US and China, too, reveal softness. US chemical exports were lower by 9.5% from a year ago at $13.4 billion in November, and imports declined 2.5%, while China\u2019s overall exports (across all sectors) fell 9.9% from a year earlier in December and imports fell 7.5%, as per analysts at Kotak.    Among chemicals, demand for discretionary applications such as dyes and pigments, polymers, and automobiles continues to face headwinds, analysts said, though demand for essentials such as agrochemicals is steady. Higher crop prices are supporting agrochemical demand, though high channel inventory could impact sales in the near term.    Although domestic demand for chemicals continues to remain healthy, exports trend needs to be monitored amid demand weakness across the European and Chinese markets, said analysts at Centrum Broking. Analysts, however, do expect companies to benefit from lower chemical prices.    \u201cMost basic chemicals saw a sharp correction in prices in Q3FY23 as crude oil prices moderated 10% sequentially and chemical feedstock prices witnessed a fall of up to 20% sequentially on weak demand. Ocean freight costs declined 40-50% sequentially and are currently back to normalized\/ historical levels. Rupee depreciated 3% versus the dollar,\" analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher said.    Chemical prices generally trended downwards sequentially in Q3, impacted by demand weakness in Europe and China. Domestic companies are expected to benefit only partially due to the spillover of high-cost inventories in Q3, said analysts at Centrum. Nonetheless, they expect some gross margin expansion for the chemical producers, with major benefits likely to accrue in the current quarter.

Ford Motor Co said Friday it is recalling 462,000 vehicles worldwide because video output may fail, preventing the rearview camera image from displaying.    The U.S. automaker said the recall covers some 2020-2023 model year Explorer, Lincoln Aviator, and 2020-2022 Lincoln Corsair vehicles equipped with 360-degree cameras and includes 382,000 in the United States.    Ford said it has reports of 17 minor crashes relating to the recall issue and more than 2,100 warranty reports but no reports of injuries. The recall expands and replaces a 2021 recall of 228,000 vehicles. Dealers will update the image processing module software and vehicles previously updated under the old recall will need the new update.    Ford said in late 2021 and 2022 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) contacted the automaker about reports of a blue image in the rear camera display after the completion of the 2021 recall, which prompted the company to investigate.    NHTSA in August 2021 opened an investigation after Ford in 2020 recalled 620,246 vehicles for another rear camera issue. The investigation is reviewing if Ford had recalled the vehicles in a timely fashion and if it recalled enough vehicles.    Ford has issued other rear camera related recalls in recent years including recalling 47,000 U.S. 2021-2022 Bronco vehicles because the rearview camera image may still be displayed after a backing event has ended, which could distract the driver.\u00a0 This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

In an interview, Ajay Garg, founder and managing director of Equirus Capital, owned 20% by Federal Bank, spoke about the dealmaking outlook for this year and the investment banking platform\u2019s plan to expand its asset and wealth management businesses with an investment of  \u20b9750 crore over the next five years. Edited excerpts:  What is the growth plan for Equirus for the next five years? How are you building out the asset management and wealth management businesses?    Equirus is rightly placed in all its businesses to enjoy significant growth in next five years. Equirus Wealth is strategically poised to significantly scale up in the next five years as both the wealth and asset management businesses have been steadily growing for the last 5-6 years and are operationally profitable as well. We are adding a tech and digital team to increase our capabilities on the digital side as we have started HNI broking, which was missing in our overall proposition. Family office is another proposition that we intend to start to cater to the segment at which Equirus parent entity has been operating over the last 15 years. At Equirus Wealth, we keep client at the centre of all decision-making and all solutions that we develop are to take care of client needs. This strategy has helped us cross  \u20b95,000 crore AUM across wealth and asset management and over the next five years, we would want to increase this penetration into partner banks by increasing our location network and RM (relationship manager) footprint. Asset management would be focussed on creating and managing high-quality alpha-generating portfolio; we would want to piggy on the alpha that we have generated for our clients in our flagship fund Equirus Long Horizon and replicating the same in a more diversified portfolio. We would also wish to add debt PMS and AIFs as a part of asset management offering, which shall in turn increase our overall proposition.  How much capital do you plan to invest in the platform for these plans? Will you look at going public to raise the funds or will you look at private equity investors?    We plan to invest around  \u20b9750 crore in all our businesses put together. There is specific deployment for our digital wealth business and NBFC business to help our wealth platform. We are also adding the direct equities options for our wealth platform. With Gift City presence, we are seeking to further our AMC vertical. Our core business of investment banking and institutional equities are looking to broaden and strengthen the capability. Besides internal accruals, we will supplement the same with the right external raising to implement the above plans.  Federal Bank is a minority investor in Equirus. Will they be investing more capital in Equirus to fund these growth plans?    Since 2018, Federal Bank has been a key investor and partner of Equirus. Post the initial investment, the bank has participated in our rights issue and has always invested in the past.  Will capital market deals such as IPOs and QIPs see a good run in 2023 or do you see a repeat of 2022?    2022 had been sluggish because of the external headwinds. Not just India, but the entire world has suffered. However, 2023 is a year of hope as we expect the headwinds to fade and therefore, capital market deals should revive. Needless to say, the backlog of 2022 itself will provide the much-needed boost. Furthermore, as we will see return of foreign capital and revival of equity markets, deals should improve. Notably, the attractiveness of Indian companies, the confidence in Indian markets remains intact. What is needed is the return of risk in the global arena which will happen with the abatement of the headwinds. Furthermore, it is imperative to note that not just the private sector, but government is also \u201ceagerly\" awaiting the momentum with a sizable divestment programme, the success of which is imperative to long term fiscal discipline and consolidation path.    Yes, tightening liquidity not just locally but globally means the easy money is no longer available. However, that only reaffirms that only those companies with strong business fundamentals will get access to the market.

Indian civil aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation has imposed a penalty of  \u20b910 lakh rupees on Go FIRST for leaving behind 55 flyers in the passenger coach at Bengaluru airport on 9 January.     The regulator had issued a show cause notice to accountable manager of the airline as to why enforcement action should not be taken against them for dereliction of their regulatory obligations.     The regulator observed from the reply of Go FIRST that there was no proper communication and coordination between terminal coordinator, commercial staff and crew regarding boarding of passengers in the aircraft.     The airline also failed to ensure adequate arrangement for ground handling, preparation of load and trim sheet, flight dispatch and passenger or cargo handling, the regulator noted.     \u201cThe airline was at fault across multiple points and no one was cross-checking on how many passengers were supposed to be on that flight.

When the bank floated its shares in New York in 1999 it declared: \u201cWe have an uncompromising determination to achieve excellence in everything we undertake.\" Conspiracy theorists have long paid it the backhanded compliment of imagining that it secretly runs the world. Yet lately the only exceptional thing about the Wall Street icon has been its mistakes.       Since October Goldman has made a u-turn on its plan to build a big consumer bank; booked one of its worst quarterly results for a decade, measured by return on equity; and attracted a probe by the Federal Reserve. The firm is not yet in serious trouble, but it is trapped by its own mythology. Its recent struggles show how hard it will be to reform\u2014and illuminate a new balance of power in global finance.       To understand Goldman today, take a walk down Wall Street. After the financial crisis of 2007-09, two big American banks reinvented themselves. JPMorgan Chase successfully pursued vast scale across a wide range of business lines. Morgan Stanley built a thriving arm managing the assets of the wealthy, which mints reliable profits. Goldman, however, stuck to its game of trading, advising on deals and bespoke investing. Penal new capital rules made this less lucrative, but the firm staked a Darwinian bet that the resulting shakeout would kill off many competitors. Instead, it badly underperformed the stockmarket for years and got ensnared in the 1mdb scandal, in which officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi received $1.6bn of bribes in 2009-14. A Goldman subsidiary pleaded guilty to a criminal charge and the firm admitted \u201cinstitutional failure\".       The firm\u2019s boss, David Solomon, took over in 2018. A man with a short fuse, he has tried to rebrand himself and to renew the firm by expanding its core and diversifying into new areas. Goldman now offers transaction banking to multinationals, helping them move funds globally. It has bulked up its asset- and wealth-management arm. And from their Manhattan skyscraper, flush Goldmanites dreamed of growing a mass-market digital bank for ordinary consumers, including a credit-card operation.       Parts of Mr Solomon\u2019s strategy have paid off. Goldman\u2019s market share in mergers and bond trading has risen, helping it make a monster $21bn in profits in 2021 as markets boomed. From taxpayers\u2019 viewpoint, it is safer, with more capital and deposits. And, importantly, its share price has recovered lost ground, rising more than the market and those of most of its peers.       Yet look more closely and the project to remake the bank is vexingly incomplete. Diversification has been patchy: transaction-banking revenues are tiny and the asset-management arm is often dragged down by opaque proprietary bets. The dream of creating a consumer bank has soured. Goldman has 15m customers, but has also faced large losses and bad-debt charges, which is why it is now winding down part of the operation.       As the prospects for a big new earnings machine have receded, everything still rests on the traditional business. The profitability of the trading arm has improved but remains volatile and, on average, pedestrian. Overall, Goldman has made reasonable use of its resources, generating a return on tangible equity of 14% over Mr Solomon\u2019s tenure. But its performance is erratic, veering from 33% in early 2021 to just 5% in the latest quarter. It has lagged behind its American peers half of the time, and the two industry leaders, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, two-thirds of the time. Investors think that Goldman is worth only the net book\u2014or liquidation\u2014value of its assets, suggesting they doubt that it can generate consistently high returns or find lucrative new areas.    Goldman\u2019s struggles point to several lessons. One is that it still excels, but in a bad industry. Investment banking combines the drawbacks of a regulated activity (capital requirements and red tape) with the vices of a speculative one (volatility and capture by employees). The firm says it has become more disciplined on pay but last year forked out $15bn, its second-highest salary and bonus bill since the financial crisis, even as profits halved to $11bn and the firm barely beat its cost of capital. The real action in finance is outside regulated banking, where a new cohort of stars rules, including Blackstone in private markets, BlackRock in index funds, and Citadel, an investing and trading house that made its clients $16bn in 2022.    Another lesson is that it is hard to compete in winner-takes-all digital markets. Goldman thought that brains and brand were enough. Not true. It has spent billions, but its customer base remains a fraction of that of PayPal or Amazon. JPMorgan reaches 66m American households, but maintains a vast physical network of branches. Goldman has achieved digital scale by teaming up with Apple to provide a credit card. However, given that the tech giant has almost a billion paying subscribers, Apple holds the whip hand in that relationship.    A final lesson is that the stagnation of globalisation has shrunk Wall Street\u2019s horizons. In the decade after Goldman listed, international revenues provided half of its growth, as its bankers conquered Europe and then broke into Asia. Today they supply a third of growth, as local competitors have emerged and some countries have become wary of foreign financiers. The number-one arranger of shares and bonds last year in China was citic Securities; in India Kotak Mahindra and Axis led the pack. These are names that many on Wall Street may not know.    Raging bulls    Can Goldman recover its swagger? Mr Solomon is wisely laying off staff and shrinking the bank\u2019s proprietary investments. Over time he may be vindicated by prosaic changes\u2014running its asset-management arm better, say, or pioneering new tech to cut exorbitant labour costs\u2014or even by orchestrating a merger.    Yet there is something uniquely hard about reforming elite firms whose unwritten code is that they are smarter than everyone else. Just ask McKinsey, a scandal-magnet once known as the world\u2019s most-admired consultancy. Goldman\u2019s culture of self-regard remains at odds with the facts. Instead it now needs to be self-critical. For yesterday\u2019s masters of the universe, that may be the hardest leap of all.  \u00a9 2023, The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved.

After months of closely-guarded, tough negotiations, Air India is set to place an order for 190 Boeing 737 MAX narrowbody planes as well as some 20 Boeing 787s and 10 Boeing 777X on a day marking one year since Tata Group took control of the former state-run carrier, the sources told Reuters.  Also Read: Air India resets as it finishes one year under the Tata fold    The second half of the order, which industry sources have told Reuters includes around 235 Airbus single-aisle jets and about 40 Airbus A350 widebody aircraft, is expected to be formally wrapped up over the coming days.    Senior Boeing, GE and CFM officials are expected in India to mark the deal on Friday.  Also Read: Tata\u200a group plans to infuse up to $1.8 bn in Air India-Vistara    Despite earlier expectations of a single coordinated announcement, it remains unclear when either deal may be publicly disclosed especially with the Aero India air show looming in February when deals like this are usually revealed.    Manufacturers Boeing and Airbus, as well as CFM's joint venture partners GE and Safran declined comment. Air India did not respond to a request for comment.    Reuters reported last month Air India was closing in on a deal for about 500 jets.  Also Read: Efficiency, costs key focus in Air India-Vistara merger drill    The order, once finalised, aims to put Air India in the league of large global airlines and make it an influential customer for planemakers and suppliers at a time when its home market is seeing a strong post-Covid travel surge.    Domestic passenger air traffic in India grew 47% in 2022 from a year ago, government data showed.    Analysts caution the airline faces intense competition given the connectivity carved out by local and international rivals.    India, which is set to overtake China as the world's most populous country, has a large, under-served air travel market dominated by budget carrier IndiGo. The bulk of India's outbound passenger traffic, however, is carried by Middle Eastern airlines like Emirates and Qatar Airways. RESURGENT AIR INDIA Under its new owners Air India is looking to restore its reputation at home and overseas as a storied carrier with impeccable service and world-class planes.    It has put back in service nearly 20 aircraft that had been grounded for years due to lack of parts and money. The airline has also said it will spend over $400 million to refurbish its entire legacy wide body fleet of 27 Boeing 787-8s and 13 777 aircraft.    The aim is to corner 30% of the domestic air travel market over the next five years thus narrowing the gap with market leader IndiGo. It also wants to increase by \"multiples\" its current share of international travel, the airline's new chief executive Campbell Wilson previously said.    Tata's four airlines, including two budget carriers, Air India and Vistara its joint venture with Singapore Airlines, have a combined market share of 24%.    Analysts have said Air India has the ability to claw back some passengers from rival Gulf carriers but not before it matches their quality of fleet and service. Nor will the domestic battle with IndiGo happen without tough competition from a carrier that continues to expand.
